        <h3>Configuration File Intro</h3>
    </p> 
    <p> 
    This document highlights file names and example config file entries by giving them a gray background and a different font. Italicised text in an example config file entry means to use some appropriate value for what the italicised term represents, not the literal words which are italicised. A pipe character, <span class="code">|</span>, between terms in a field definition means to use only one of the terms which are separated by the pipe(s).
    </p> 
    <p> 
        <span class="code">NoQuarter.cfg</span> is the main config file. The program works by creating file associations. When working in the config file, it might help to remember that the whole point is to define that a certain file extension should be opened with a certain program. Almost everything else in the config file is in support of this concept. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
        Spaces: leading and trailing spaces get stripped as much as possible: they get stripped from beginning of lines, and from the values of fields, so use as many spaces as you like to line up and format your data.
    </p> 
    <p> 
        Comments: Create a comment line (that is, a line to make notes for yourself and which will be ignored by the NoQuarter program), by starting it with a pound sign.
    </p> 
    </p> 
        Directories: Wherever a directory may be part of the value for a field, you may use an absolute path or a path relative to where nq.exe is sitting on your hard drive. When you enter a directory which includes spaces as a field value, be sure to enclose it in quotes.
    </p> 
    <p> 
    <h3><span id="uservars">User-Defined Variables and Conditional Blocks</span></h3>
    </p> 


    <p> 
       To make the config file easier to manage, you can define your own variables. These variables will cause nq.exe to perform text substitutions when it processes the configuration file. The format is the variable name enclosed in dollar signs, an equal sign, and then the value to assign to the variable. For example, the line:
    </p> 
    <p> 
        <span class="code">$ROMSDIR$ = C:\users\zanzibarbuckbuckmcfate\roms</span>
    </p> 
    <p> 
        ...creates a variable named $ROMSDIR$, and any subsequent instance of the string $ROMSDIR$ in the config file will be replaced with the text on the right side of the equals sign. So later in the file, when it comes time to load roms from your arcade, genesis, and snes subfolders, instead of typing: <br>
        <span class="code">C:\users\zanzibarbuckbuckmcfate\roms\arcade</span><br>
        <span class="code">C:\users\zanzibarbuckbuckmcfate\roms\genesis</span><br>
        <span class="code">C:\users\zanzibarbuckbuckmcfate\roms\snes</span>
    </p> 
    <p> 
        You could type:<br>
        <span class="code">$ROMSDIR$\arcade</span><br>
        <span class="code">$ROMSDIR$\genesis</span><br>
        <span class="code">$ROMSDIR$\snes</span>
    </p> 
    <p> 
        And if you change the location of your roms, you just need to edit the variable assignment line instead of editing the three other lines.
    </p> 
    <p> 
    The other convenience I have for working with the config file is the support of conditional blocks, similar to the c preprocessor directive #ifdef, except NQ uses an ampersand instead of the pound sign.
    </p>
    <p>
        The line:
        <br>
        <span class="code">&ampifdef WINDOWS</span>
        <br>
        ...means that unless the WINDOWS trigger was defined, then all subsequent lines will be ignored until the line
        <br>
        <span class="code">&ampendif</span>
        <br>
        - or -
        <br>
        <span class="code">&ampelse</span>
        ...is encountered.
        <br>
        <br>
        If an <span class="code">&ampelse</span> line is encountered between a <span class="code">&ampifdef <i>something</i></span> and a <span class="code">&ampendif</span>, then the lines between the <span class="code">&ampelse</span> and <span class="code">&ampendif</span> will be processed if and only if the trigger in the most recent <span class="code">&ampifdef</span> was not defined.
        <br><br>
        To define a trigger, use <span class="code">&ampdefine <i>triggername</i></span> anywhere in the file before the trigger is referenced in a <span class="code">&ampifdef <i>triggername</i></span> line.  
        <br>
        Here is a full example of using condidional blocks:
    </p> 
    <span class="code">&ampdefine WINDOWS</span><br>
    <span class="code">&ampifdef WINDOWS</span><br>
    <span class="code">&lt<i>20 lines of configuration</i>&gt</span><br>
    <span class="code">&ampelse</span><br>
    <span class="code">&lt<i>15 lines of configuration</i>&gt</span><br>
    <span class="code">&ampendif</span><br>
    <p>
        In this case, the 20 lines of configuration will be processed, but the next 15 lines will not. If we comment out the WINDOWS trigger definition by changing the first line to:
        <br>
    <span class="code">#&ampdefine WINDOWS</span><br>
    ...then the first 20 lines of configuration will be ignored, and the next 15 will be processed.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have found the conditional blocks to be mostly useful for hardware changes: I use one block defined for CRT screen geometry vs another block defined for LCD widescreen geometry, and then I use one block defined for a certain game controller mapping versus a different block defined for when a different controller is plugged in, and I use one block defined for Windows folder locations and another block defined for Linux folder locations.
    <p> 
        <h3>NQ Variables</h3>
    </p> 
    <p> 
    There is another kind of variable, and these are configuration variables for the program. These variables take the form <span class="code">?<i>variablename value</i></span>. Most of these variables are related to configuring the screen, and this activity deserves its own page, so <a href="configfile2.html">click here</a> to learn about the configuration variables. Any variable not defined will receive a default value, so  it's not imperative to define these variables immediately. If you're still on the fence about using NQ, then I would skip that page for now, and instead keep reading on here to learn about setting up your emulators and roms.
    </p> 

    <h3>Images</h3>
    All images will be resized to fit the maximum area available to them, while maintaining their width:height ratio (they will not be skewed). So nearly all images will end being letter-boxed or pillar-boxed within their alotted screen space, unless they happen to match the aspect ratio of their designated screen space.
        <h3>Directories</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <span class="code">ahk</span> <br> If you want a certain AHK script to run every time a certain emulator is run, then compile your AHK script, name it with the <a href="#refname">emulator's reference name</a>, and put it in this folder. If you want an AHK script to run when a certain rom is run, then compile your ahk script and name it the same as the rom, swapping out the rom's extension for the .exe of the compiled script. 
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">banners</span> <br> Volumes may be represented by an image file instead of their name. I only created this functionality because I liked having an image of five stars to represent my "favorites" volume. But any volume may use this functionality. Place an image file with th same base name as the name of the volume in this folder to have it be used as a banner image for that volume.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">font</span> <br> Font files for menu entries and tier labels need to go in this directory. 
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">logos</span> <br> Hardware logo images need to go in here.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">posters</span> <br> Posters are the main images used to represent games. Posters need to go in this directory, or in a subdirectory of this directory. Posters may be .jpg or .png files.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">slideshow</span> <br>
            Create a folders under this directory named after the base name of your roms, put the screenshots for the games under these folders, and now you've got the slideshows.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">sprites</span> <br>
            Place the sprite sheets for rascal animations here.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Starting Fresh</h3>
        <p>To remove the demo data to make way for your data:</p>
        <p>
        To start with a fresh noquarter.cfg file, you can either remove the lines of demo data under the various sections of the noquarter.cfg file which came with the download, or just copy or rename the file skeleton.cfg to "noquarter.cfg".
        </p>
        <p>
        If you don't want any of the slideshow screenshots, posters, banners, hardware logos, or sprites which came with the download (I included them for the demo), then delete them under the directories "slideshow", "posters", "banners", "logos", and "sprites".
        </p>
        <p>
        Remove all of the data from favorites.txt.

        <h3>The sections of noquarter.cfg:</h3>

    <p> 
    <h3><span id="emulatorconfig">[emulator config]</span></h3>
    Configure your emulators. You can find many examples <a href="examples.html">here</a>. Format:<br>
        <span class="code" id="refname"><i>reference name, directory, executable, options, argument type, input config FSO [, minimize]</i></span> 
        <ul>
            <li>
            <span class="code">reference name</span>: Assign a name to this emulator configuration.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">emulator directory</span>: This is the directory where the emulator which you want associated with the extension/file is sitting. No Quarter will change to this directory right before running the emulator. If the emulator is on your OS's path environmental variable and so it doesn't matter where it is called from, then you can use <span class="code">@</span> as the value for this field, and No Quarter will stay in its own home directory when calling the emulator.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">emulator executable:</span> Self-explanatory, I hope.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">options:</span> Put in whatever command-line arguments and switches (other than the rom name) you need for the emulator. By default, a space and then the rom name will automatically be added to the end of the list of arguments when a rom is selected to run. If the rom name needs to appear on the command line somewhere other than after a space at the end of the list of arguments, then place the <span class="code">@</span> symbol at the position in this field to represent where the rom name should go. You will also need to do this if your rom names have spaces in them, so you would have to put this: <span class="code">"@"</span> somewhere in this options field.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code" id="argtype">argument type</span>: This is how much of the rom's path/name should be passed to the emulator. There are four valid values:
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="code">base</span>: The base name of the rom file, meaning the file extension should not be included.</li>
                    <li><span class="code">file</span>: The full file name, including the extension.</li>
                    <li><span class="code">full</span>: The full path and file name.</li>
                    <li><span class="code">noarg</span>: The rom name is not required to be passed as an argument. Use this when the emulator is only used for one game and is configured to always run that one game when it is launched. Also use for games which are OS native executables.</li>
                </ul>
                Be aware that if you use either <span class="code">base</span> or <span class="code">file</span> here, then that very likely means that your emulator has its own list of paths to search. This must be configured separately in your emulators.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="code">input config FSO</span>: FSO = file system object. This is either a directory or a file (a directory for the on-controller-change-only version, a file for the per-game version). No Quarter can manage per-game controller configuration for any emulator which does not already natively support per-game controller configuration. It similarly allows you to manage emulator controller configuration when switching between input devices. This is a labor-intensive feature, so I advise skipping over this section until you've decided you will be using NQ and you are going to make use of this feature. Whether or not you use this feature, the least you need to know about it is that a valid FSO is required in this field, so I recommend using the emulator's directory as a dummy value for this field, and then you can skip down to reading about the <span class="code"><a href="#associations">[associations]</a></span> section.<br><br>
            Let's look at emulator input device swapping management first. You would use this feature in the case where an emulator natively supports per-game configuration, but you want to use NQ to manage changing those per-game configurations when you change input devices. For example, I use it for Mame and Mednafen when I switch between different input devices. On the <a href="configfile2.html">variables page</a>, you see there is a variable <span class="code">?input</span>, in which you create whatever name you want for an input device. NQ keeps track of the last value of this variable in the file <span class="code">lastcontroller</span>. This is a text file which contains the value of <span class="code">?input</span> (with the addition of a leading underscore) from the last time NQ was run. To allow the use of different input mappings based on switching between different physical input devices, repeat this process for each input device (this will only fully work if the emulator stores its per-game configs in a seperate file for each game, and if the default config file is in the same directory as the per-game config files):
            <br><br>
            <ol>  
                <li>
                    Decide on a name for the device, and create a folder for the device under the folder which holds the emulator's per-game configuration files, and name the folders the name of the input device, prepended with an underscore. Using mame for an example (mame stores its per-game config files under the directory <span class="code">cfg</span>), under the main mame folder, I have the folders 
                    <span class="code">cfg\_keyboard</span> ,
                    <span class="code">cfg\_gamepad1</span> , and
                    <span class="code">cfg\_ultratsik</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Plug in the device and configure the emulator for it, and do so for each game if you have different game configurations. Make sure each configuration is saved.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The emulator also likely has a default configuration file, which you should configure with the defaults for the controller.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Copy all of the per-game configuration files and the default config file to the folder you created in the first step. 
                </li>
            </ol>  
            <br>
            After this is done, then you can change emulator input configurations by changing the value of <span class="code">?input</span> in noquarter.cfg. The next time NQ is run, it will see that the value of <span class="code">?input</span> is different, and will copy the config files out of the directory <span class="code">_<i>input device</i></span> over the existing configuration files one level up for every emulator which has such a named directory. A downside to this technique is that if you decide to change any other type of configuration for your emulator(s) which happen to be stored in the same files as input configuration, then you will lose those changes the next time you change the value of <span class="code">?input</span>, unless you make that change in all of the copies you made in the subdirectories you created.
            <br><br>
            Per-game input configuration management: Use this for emulators which do not natively support per-game configuration.
            <br><br>
            <ol>  
                <li>
                    If you have not already configured per-controller configuration, then you need to do some of it now. Even if you do not plan to ever change your input device, you still need to create one folder per emulator named after your permanent input device. Decide on a name for the device, and create a folder at the same level as the configuration file for the emulator which holds input config, and name the folder the name of the input device, prepended with an underscore.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Configure the emulator for default key bindings.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Copy the configuration file to the folder you created in the first step.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For each game:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Configure input for the game, and make sure the config gets saved to file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Copy the configuration file to a file named with the rom's name, and with the same extension as the original file.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Move the copy to the folder you created in the first step.
                        </li>
                    </ol>  
                </li>
            </ol>  
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">minimize:</span> When NQ launches a game, most emulators will be missing the video, or have some other issue, if NQ does not first minimize itself. So far, I think only Mame does not require NQ to minimize itself. This field is optional, but if you add it, then NQ will minimize itself before running an emulator. The value you use for this field does not matter, but you do have to put in some kind of dummy value. Just a comma and then nothing after it will not count as this field existing.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <h3><span id="associations">[associations]</span></h3>
        This section creates an association between a file extension (roms) and a program (emulator). There are two other types of associations, other than file extension associations: a unique association, which associates a full file name with a program, and a folder + extension combination association, which is a file extension association applicable only to the files in a certain folder.  The format is:
        <br>
        <span class="code"><i>extension </i>| <i>name</i> | <i>folder + extension, emulator reference name</i></span>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <span class="code">extension | name | folder + extension</span>: This field is where you define either a file extension or a specific file to be associated with an emulator and the other configuration values represnted by fields on this line with either a file extension or a specific file. This field takes one of three forms:
                <ul>
                    <li>universal extension association: associates a file extension with a configured emulator. Include the leading dot, so typical example values for this field would be <span class="code">.7z</span> and <span class="code">.sfc</span>.</li>
                    <li>unique association: associates a specific file with a configured emulator. Use the whole file name (but not including the path) instead of the extension.</li> 
                    <li>directory-specific extension association: associates the files of a directory which have the indicated extension with a configured emulator. This is used to over-ride a universal extension association for a specific directory. Create this type of association by providing a path name followed by the extension, including the dot. There is no wildcard character used to represent the base name of the roms. An example of this form is <span class="code">\some\path\.7z</span> Keep in mind that even though you indicate a directory here, this will not load roms from that directory into any rom list. Using this form is only saying that if the named directory is loaded into a rom list (in the <span class="code">[load roms]</span> section), then use this association for those roms. So any directory named here should also appear in the <span class="code">[load roms]</span> section.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">emulator reference name</span>: A reference name you defined in the previous section.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p> 
    <p> 
        <h3>[aliases]</h3>
        The roms in rom lists are sorted alphabetically. Mame requires that roms have specific names. If you want a Mame rom to sort in the list as though it had a different name, then create an alias for it in this section. This alias will also become the display name, unless you also create an entry for the rom in <span class="code">displaynames.txt</span>, in which case the name in displaynames.txt will be the display name, but it will still sort based on the alias created here. Format:
        <span class="code"><i>rom base name, alias</i></span> 
        <ul>
            <li>
            <span class="code">rom base name</span> The name of the rom, without the file extension.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">alias</span> The name of the rom for alphabetical sorting purposes. Will also be the display name if there is no entry for it in <span class="code">displaynames.txt</span>
            </li>
        </ul>

    The next section, <span class="code">[load roms]</span>, is where you load files from directories into rom lists. Before we get there, you can exclude certain files in those directories from being loaded by naming them in this section. Separate file names by any mix of new lines or spaces (if you have spaces in your file names, then you are out of luck here). Use the full file name without the path, or you can use a directory and extension combo. I use this mostly for bios roms, and for parent/clones when you only want either the parent or the clone to be loaded into the menu. Format:
    <br><br>
    <span class="code"><i>file name</i> | <i>directory and extension combo</i></span> 
    <br><br>
    The directory and extension combo works the same here as it does for the associations section. For example, I use this: <span class="code">roms\psx\.bin</span> because I load this directory in the <span class="code">[load roms]</span> section, but I only want the cue files. There are also .bin files in this directory, but since .bin is associated with a Genesis emulator, those .bin files would get loaded too if I did not have this "ignore" entry for them.

        <h3>[load roms]</h3>
        NQ uses two levels of grouping (also referred to as tiers). The top level (or tier) is called volumes, and the bottom level is called rom lists. This section defines volumes and the rom lists they contain, and populates your rom lists with roms from your directories. You can load multiple directories into a list, and you can have one directory loaded into multiple lists. Only files with extensions which have an association defined will be loaded. Keep in mind any file you want put into a rom list from favorites.txt must first be loaded into some other rom list from this section. Format:
        <br> <br>
        <span class="code"><i>volume, rom list, directory [, hardware logo]</i></span>
        <br>
        - OR -
        <br>
        <span class="code"><i>volume, rom list</i></span>
        <br>
        <br>
        Use the second format for rom lists which will only be populated by the <span class="code">favorites.txt</span> file. Such rom lists do still need to be defined in this section.
        <ul>
            <li>
            <span class="code">volume</span>: The name of the volume which the rom list (the next field) belongs to. Naming the volume here defines/creates it. When you cycle through volumes as you use NQ, they will cycle in the order that they first appear on lines in this section of the config file. The only invalid characters for volume names are the comma and the semicolon.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">rom list</span>: The name of the rom list which the roms will be loaded into. Naming the rom list here defines/creates it. When you cycle through rom lists as you use NQ, they will cycle in the order that they first appear on lines in this section of the config file. The only invalid characters for rom list names are the comma and the semicolon.

            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">directory</span>: The directory to load roms from. This may be an absolute path, or a path relative to where NQ is installed. Only files which have extensions for which you created an association will be loaded. 
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">hardware logo</span>: A .png or .jpg file which you have placed under the <span class="code">logos/</span> directory to represent the hardware which these roms run on (or any other image which you want associated with all of the files in this directory). This field is optional.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p> 
    <p> 
        <h3>[key config]</h3>
        Configure keyboard controls to navigate NQ. Format:
        <br> <br>
        <span class="code"><i>nq function, SDL decimal keycode</i> | <i>character</i></span>
        <br> <br>
        <b>Navigation functions</b>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="code">prev rom</span> Go up one rom in the list
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">next rom</span> Go down one rom in the list
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">beginning</span> Jump to the beginning of the rom list (the list scrolls circularly, so this also puts you one rom away from the end of the list)
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">middle</span> Jump to the middle of the rom list
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">1/3</span> Jump 1/3 of the way through the rom list. This also looks at the list circularly, so if the jump would put you X number of games past the end, you will end up X number of games from the beginning. For the sake of simplifying using NQ on your cabinet, I suggest either assigning buttons to both the "beginning" and "middle" functions and leave this function unassigned, or leave those two functions unassigned and assign a button to this function.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">prev list</span> Go to the next rom list in the volume
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">next list</span> Go to the previous rom list in the volume
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">prev volume</span> Go to the previous volume
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">next volume</span> Go to the next volume
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">run</span> Run the currently-selected rom
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">exit</span> exit NQ
            </li>
        </ul>
        Character or SDL decimal keycode
        <ul>
            <li>
                You can find SDL keycodes <a href=https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDLKeycodeLookup>here</a>. If you are going to identify a key by the SDL keycode, then you need to use the decimal value (the left-most column). You can figure out the key name by looking at the right-most column...
            </li>
            <li>
                ...but for most keys (keys which map to printable characters), you can just put the character for that key in this field.
            </li>
        </ul>
            <br>
            <b>Alternative scrolling functions:</b>
            <br> <br>
            There are three things which can be scrolled through: volumes (scroll through the different volumes), rom lists (scroll between rom lists of a volume), and roms (scroll through the roms in the current list). You might prefer to scroll through all three things using a joystick (or arrow buttons), but joysticks (arrow buttons) only have two axes. Using the functions defined above, you would have to pick one of the three things to be scrolled through using buttons. The following functions allow you to use a joystick (arrow buttons) for all three, by assigning a button to be the tier toggle. Hitting the "tier toggle" button will cause focus for left/right scrolling to be switched between volumes and rom lists. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="code">tier toggle</span> Toggle between volumes and rom lists for scrolling focus. If this function is defined, then two little focus-indicator icons will appear on each side of the outline-shape/frame of the tier label which has focus. So when volumes have focus, you will see these icons next to both sides of that pinkish box at the top of the screen which frames the name of the volumes. When the rom list tier has scrolling focus, you will see the icons just outside the pinkish box at the bottom of the screen which frames rom list names.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">prev tier item</span> If the "volume" tier has scrolling focus, then go back one volume. If the "rom list" tier has scrolling focus, then go back one rom list.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">next tier item</span> If the "volume" tier has scrolling focus, then go forward one volume. If the "rom list" tier has scrolling focus, then go forward one rom list.
            </li>
        </ul>
            <br>
            <b>GUI functions:</b>
            <br> <br>
            The first three functions are used to populate favorites-style rom lists. These functions make changes to the file favorites.txt, which you can just as easily edit manually if you want. The last function is for changing the menu's display names of your roms, and will edit the file displaynames.txt, which may also be edited manually as an alternative to using this in-program function.
            <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="code">collect</span> Adds the current rom to a buffer of collected roms. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">paste</span> Pastes all collected roms into the current rom list. The roms in a list are sorted alphabetically, and all pasted roms will be inserted alphabetically, so it doesn't matter where in the list you are when you hit the button which calls this function. Pasting clears the buffer.
            </li>
            <li>
            <span class="code">delete</span> Deletes the current rom from the current rom list. This will only work if the rom is in the list because it was added as a favorite (which happens when you add it with the collect &amp paste features described just above, or if you manually added it in the file <span class="code">favorites.txt</span>). If the rom is in the list because it was loaded into this list because of a line in the <span class="code">[load roms]</span> section, then it will not be deleted. The only way to remove such roms from rom lists is to delete the rom file from the directory it was loaded from.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="code">display name</span> Create or change the display name for the current rom. This only changes what you see in the menu list, it does not rename the rom file. The display name is not used for alphabetical sorting, only the file name is used. You will see two vertical lines on the input field. These lines represent the width of the area used to display rom names in the menu. If the name you type expands beyond these guides, then the name will exceed the allowed area for game names in the menu. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p> 
    <p> 
        <h3>[joy config]</h3>
        Configure a joystick to navigate NQ. Format:
        <br> <br>
        <span class="code"><i>nq function, joystick button</i></span>
        <br> <br>
        NQ functions: Use the list from the previous section.
        <br> <br>
        Joystick button: The button number on the joystick. There is a helper program in the same directory as nq.exe, joytest.exe. Run this program and press a button on your joystick to see which number you should enter for the value of this field. You cannot map the analog up/down and left/right axes. They are hardcoded to prevrom/nextrom/prevlist/nextlist. If you have more than one joystick plugged in, NQ does not differentiate between which device sent a joystick button. So if you have multiple joysticks of different types, then input from any of them will be processed, but only the one you configured NQ for will be guaranteed to have the correct functions mapped to the correct buttons.
