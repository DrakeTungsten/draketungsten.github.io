        <h3>NQ Variables</h3>
    </p> 

    <p> 
    This page documents all of the variables available to configure the behavior of NQ. As mentioned on the page which documents the config file sections, there are two different types of variables which may appear in the config file. This page concerns variables which NQ understands and uses to change its appearance or behavior, and these variables require specific names. <a href="configfile1.html#uservars">The other type of variable</a> is the user-defined variable, which are variables where you define the name as well as the value, and are meant to be a convenience for working with the configuartion file. Make sure you are on the right page to read about the kind of variable you are interested in.
    </p> 
    NQ variables should appear at the top of the file, before the <span class="code">[emulator config]</span> section. They take the form:
    <br><br>
        <span class="code">?<i>varname value</i></span> 
        <br> <br>
        If you've already familiarized yourself with some of the documentation on configuration sections, you will have noticed that lines of data for the various sections all separate their fields with a comma. Variable definitions are different, they just require white space to separate the variable name from the value.
    <br><br>

    <ul>
        <li>

Set to <span class="code">0</span> for normal single-tap exiting.
