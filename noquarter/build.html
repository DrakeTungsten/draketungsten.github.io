    <h3>BUILD</h3>
    <b>Windows:</b>
    <br>
    Built in Windows with MSYS2.
    <br><br>
These are more or less the instructions I followed from a post in Stack Exchange to install MSYS2. It wasn't crystal clear and I didn't take good notes as I was doing this, but this will get you at least really close, if not all the way, to having an MSYS2 install for building the source:
<br>
<br>
Download and run the msys2 installer.
<br>
<br>
<span class="code">
pacman -Sy pacman
</span>
<br>
[close and re-open]
<br>
<br>
<span class="code">
pacman -Syu
</span>
<br>
[close and re-open]
<br>
<br>
<span class="code">
pacman -Su
</span>
[close and re-open???]
<br>
<br>
<span class="code">
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
</span>
<br>
<span class="code">
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
</span>
<br>
   ??? probably don't do this one:
<span class="code">
 pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL
</span>
<br>
<span class="code">
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2
</span>
<br>
<span class="code">
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_image
</span>
<br>
<span class="code">
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf
</span>
<br>
<span class="code">
pacman -S make
</span>
<br>
<p>
Once it's all installed, open a MinGW64 command promt, cd to where No Quarter is (the root of your C: drive is <span class="code">/c</span> in mingw), then cd to the "src" directory. type <span class="code">make -f makefile.mingw</span> This will compile, and also place a copy of nq.exe in the parent folder (there is no separate "install" target) ready to go.
<p>
<br><br>
    <b>Linux:</b>
    <br>
    Not much to say. I had one library missing, but I forgot what it was. Whatever it was, it was easy enough to install from Ubuntu's repos. Make sure to comment out the #define NQ_WINDOWS directive and un-comment the #define NQ_LINUX directive in the source.
