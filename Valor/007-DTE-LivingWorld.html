-Threat doing threat stuff secretly

-Threat doing threat stuff openly

-Threat doing threat stuff that broadens the stakes. (Negatively affects or puts at risk more of the world’s people and/or places)

-Threat doing threat stuff that deepens the stakes. (affects more of the PC’s personal interests and valued people/places)

-Threat doing threat stuff that removes options or resources that could have helped PCs deal with the threat.

-Threat doing threat stuff that makes it seem like the outlook is dimming, chance of defeating the threat is rapidly dwindling down to zero.

-Threat wins.
