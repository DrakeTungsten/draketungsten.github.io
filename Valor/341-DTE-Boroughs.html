				<p>Whhh okay, deep breath, this is going to be a big one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>M. John Harrison’s Viriconium was one of the big inspirations that brought <a title="Cörpathium" href="https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/tag/corpathium/">Cörpathium</a> into existence, and one of the things that I loved most about those stories was that the city was never the same; places move, facts shift, but it remains Viriconium. So that’s something that I wanted for mine, a city that could be destroyed and brought back without just hitting a reset button, and is why my magic mishap and city encounter tables are so gleefully full of potentially world shattering stuff: I’ve never been worried about having to start again, it’s fun if everything gets torn down.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I’m not writing fiction here, I’m writing things that need to be used. Actually throwing everything out and starting from scratch would be an insane thing and a huge waste of my time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my answer was to write up twenty potential boroughs, a method for randomly generating the entire city with a dice drop, and conditional variations based on what boroughs end up existing and which dice generated them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First you take a 7 dice set and 5 other d20’s in your hands (or more if you like go nuts) and drop them in front of you, trying to keep them reasonably close together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each dice represents a different borough. Their position doesn’t necessarily show the physical layout of the city, just how the boroughs relate to one another.</p>
<p>You take the points of the shape on the top of each dice (well, just the points for the d4, and for the d10’s pretend they have a triangle on top), and if that leads to another dice, those boroughs are accessible to each other, which ends up looking like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the numbers on each dice relate to a different borough on the table below. Go through the 7 dice set first, beginning with the d20, then move to the highest number of the other d20’s. If you get a duplicate number, replace it with the next lowest number not already taken by a smaller dice, and if all the lower numbers are already taken, roll on the <a href="https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/in-corpathium/#additionalundefinedboroughs">Additional Undefined Boroughs</a> tables.</p>

<p>Which I roll on and get a poor borough, The Drowning Mass: Inhabited below the streets in the sewers and tunnels and carven halls, the lavish buildings above abandoned to superstition.</p>
<p>Which means I need to roll a rich borough to go on top of it and get Báthory: The cobblestones are carved like the beautiful faces of youth, scrubbed daily to shine by hump-backed cleaners.</p>
<p>Which is awesome.</p>

<p>The actual dice that generated each borough also determines another variation, which you’ll find in the Dice Variance tables below. I’m not going to list all of the ones I got here, but among other things it did result in a huge flesh giant being under construction, and the in-vogue religion being Yoon-Quiun, most hated enemy of Roy’s snake worshipping <a title="Mystic" href="https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/religion-is-a-nest-of-serpents/">Mystic</a>, which I think is pretty funny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway here are the full borough descriptions. Really most of these could be used as cities all by themselves, they don’t <em>have</em> to be in Cörpathium. In fact after generating the city above for our current game, one of the first things I did was decide that the the Sulphurous Spires wrapped around the Demiurge Pit would be a whole other city to visit.</p>
<p>The Additional Undefined Boroughs could also be used for extra neighbourhoods outside the main walls or to pop up unexpectedly if you travel down an unfamiliar path or whatever you want.</p>
<p>Really, I’m incredibly happy with this, it feels like nose to tail cooking in RPG form and I love it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make your own Cörpathium.</p>

<strong><em>The Work:</em></strong> An enormous bronze sculpture of a bulging sac-like body supported by the legs of lions, stretching up, raising its beautiful female faces to the sky, open-mouthed, crying out from the mass. The ethereal wordless singing issuing from them is beyond reproach.<br>
<br>
<em>He is kidnapping beautiful young songstresses, plying them with long-lived hallucinogens, and placing them within the sculpture amongst a nest of stinging insects.

Just looking at it fills your heart with rapture and the world seems brighter, louder, more full of life.<br>
<br>
<em>She didn't mean it to happen, it just came out the way it did, but now the longer people look at it, the more the paint is starting to decompose and she doesn't know how to fix it.

<strong><em>The Work:</em></strong> It started as a mural which consumed the side of a three-storey building, utterly black, very conceptual, completely insipid. But gradually we noticed that it had, if anything, darkened. And then the figures appeared, crawling over each other in the centre of the wall in a ball, and they were beautiful. Creatures of form unimaginable, but beautiful.<br>
But now, we're seeing them in our dreams, and when they arrive in their splendour all else becomes a tortuous nightmare, sleep has become as a curse, but the figures grow ever more beautiful, day, by day.<br>

<strong><em>The Work:</em></strong> A bouquet of gorgeously blooming flowers twice as high and thrice as wide as a man, seemingly carved from a single piece of pink marble. So lifelike that fat, furry bees land upon them and busy themselves as if they were collecting pollen before flying away.<br>
Severin seems to be playing on that now because marble hives have been hung from buildings, and there's a small marble girl below one of them, arms flung up in the air as if she were fending off a swarm, the craftsmanship is remarkable, I honestly never thought she'd amount to anything.<br>

<strong><em>The Work:</em></strong> A monumental rococo-looking clock, full of life-size bronze figures with variously personal animalistic features, spacious enough that you can step inside it, stare up at the clockwork grind behind the moon-like face of the clock.<br>
The figures move, they play out little theatrics, different every day.<br>
<br>

<strong><em>The Work:</em></strong> An ever-flowing fountain of deliciously coloured paints pouring seamlessly into the outstretched goblets of three wrestling boys twisted about the feet of a round-bodied girl, her breasts just starting to form, a tipping vessel held at her stomach, a sardonic smile on her lips. The boys move like a carousel, their position changing slightly, their goblet raised up to steal the flow from the last, the colour of the paint changing to another unseen shade at just that moment.<br>
<br>
<em>Other artists have been collecting paint from the fountain, using it in their own works, it is the best they've ever done, they shake and sweat by the fountain waiting for the same shade to appear again, violence breaks out between two painters vying for the same stream, neither has used that shade before but beyond all doubt they believe it is what they've been waiting for.</em></td>

<strong><em>The Work:</em></strong> A ten foot tall bell jar covering a cylinder topped with an iron crown, air tight, the cylinder covered in a continuous mural done in oils. Tapping and rubbing the glass of the jar produces a pleasant hum, the sound changes the painting, features move and transform, aspects of the person that caused the sound slowly manifest the longer they persist.<br>

The mould that grows in the Sporous Apiary can be dried and ground into a powder, then fermented to produce the viscous purple narcotic known as Royal Honey.

Addicts have been known to collapse like putrefying mushrooms when their body can no longer bear the strain, while others enter a symbiotic state with the fungus, becoming infested with it inside and out in a constant state of euphoria. The bodily fluids of these Sporous Queens is like having distilled Royal Honey on tap, making them lucrative possessions.<br>

The Sporous Apiary is a sprawl, nearly impossible to define, only a handful of recognisable streets have been recorded, named by prior explorers according to their experiences.<br>

<strong><em>Sights, Smells, etc.</em></strong><br>
If you find yourself within the zone, breathing the air isn't recommended for several rather good reasons. But if you did, you'd find the scent varies from the wretchedly repugnant to the embarrassingly alluring, as do the sights.<br>
Flesh-melted fools on one corner of the hazy slum, smooth-skinned pink-eyed beauty reclining on another.</td><td class="column-2"><strong><em>Morning:</em></strong><br>
The Chorus of Woe; every single resident of the Plague Zone greeting the morning with a mournful harmonious wail.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Noon:</em></strong><br>
Transgressions, transformations, solicitations, half-hearted revolting revolts slapping wetly against the boundary walls.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Night:</em></strong><br>
Daring black market incursions and bizarre celebrations.</td><td class="column-3"><strong><em>It's All a Matter of Perspective Darling</em></strong><br>
Certainly, the maladies afflicting the Plague Zone are abhorrent, but that doesn't mean we have to be <em>unhappy</em>.<br>
Where else can you see colours like this? Witness flesh doing things like this all of its own will? In what other life can you recline in glory, sustained by your own altered functions, surrounded by the pretty trinkets people bring you that they may sample of your body?<br>
I live a life of fuchsia and gold, of crawling scents and rebirth.<br>
It's all a matter of perspective darling.</td>

<br>
They're also unusually happy with living in such close proximity to other spiders. They'll still eat each other when they need to, but they'll be oh so dreadfully sorry about it.<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Gods-Damned Pests</em></strong><br>
If you're unlucky enough to live near the Black Web, you quickly learn how to barricade your home for the night and sleep with a big fuck-off knife beneath your pillow. The worst part is clearing away the webs outside with pike and halberd in the morning, they just get it everywhere, and the damned things keep coming back, chittering like disappointed old biddies.</td>

    <p>Well thank you, I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>Absolutely at some point I’ll put together an actual book, I’d basically just like to get things to the point where I feel like I could sit down with said book and nothing else and run an amazing game.</p>
<p>Definitely agreed on enjoying being surprised as much as the players as well, which is something I’m going back to some of my old generators and procedures to make them faster and more interesting. It’s funny how different things seem when you’re playing consistently instead of once every month or two.</p>

    <p>Wrote this up when adapting your setting thought I’d share it with you since you’re partly responsible.</p>
<p>Corpathium is a human city and is relatively new on the continent of Karth.The human’s love city life and the elaborate bureaucracies of churches, states, guilds, gangs, and beggars that come with it. They know little of the Dwarves hiding in their deep houses of stone, or the Gnomes in their hillsides. They know the Elves least of all. To the human city dwellers, the manipulated trees of Elven villages are only stories and Corpathium’s street dwellers would be hard pressed to tell a High Elf from a dryad. For humans the night is dark, the forests are inhospitable, and the creatures that inhabit these places are utterly alien. </p>
<p>The four human races who inhabit the city of Corpathium are as follows,</p>
<p>The Moors: these men and women are ebony black like obsidian. Their eyes are milky white without pupils. Their traditional dress is silken and flowing, often covered with gold and lapis lazuli jewelry hammered into the shapes of goats, horses, or ancestors. They are traditionally seen as shrewd merchants and landowners but are often outside of the political or royal power structures of the city, as such they must use wealth to secure their place in the world. Whereas most slaves are forced into slavery by debt or violence, the Moors often send their sons into slavery so as to create a larger inheritance for their eldest or most capable son. If these young boys manage, through shrewd dealings, to become free and earn their own fortunes then they are entitled to begin a new family with its own name. This does not happen with daughters. If you are a moor you probably have a series of anklets or bracelets for every three years you have been older than 10. If not then you’re probably embarrassingly poor. Every moor will notice this and some will even refuse you entry into their homes because of it. Moors don’t wear shoes but the men will wash the feet of their wives and preserve them when they go out by using sandals or rickshaws. The purpose is to show that your wife has no need or desire to leave her home and walk the streets, her husband has given her servants to do those things for her.</p>
<p>The Saxons: these men and women are very much like the ancient Germanic tribes of earth. They often braid their hair and many live down near the Dockmaw where they work and breath in salty sea air. Some have become affluent businessmen in the wake of incredibly profitable voyages. These men shake hands and trade with the richest Moors, although without the rings that represent adulthood in Moorish society they are still considered children and are often not allowed in Moorish homes. Saxon (or Urgoth, as they call themselves) women are almost always red-headed. In the rare event that a male child is born red-headed the men all cut the babe and bleed him slightly in the days before the child’s body can clot the blood to stop the bleeding. This is done to release the excess of blood which has made the hair red and is said to cause these rare individuals to be full of rage and weak to disease. In the old days before Saxons came to Corpathium and the shores of Karth, they would not bleed the child but let him grow into his rage and become a berserker. Saxons cut their beards when they lose a battle. Saxon women do not cut their hair, the red hair is supposed to hold their blood and if it is cut they may bleed to death during menstruation.</p>
<p>The Morgens: These black haired, bushy eyebrowed, men and women never have blue eyes or blonde hair. They may have green eyes or brown hair but only about 20% of the time. Their skin is a porcelain white milky color but they do not burn red in the sun like the pasty saxons. They consider themselves closest to the fey people and tell stories about the dwarves and elves. They have many superstitions about these creatures. They say when a girl is born you must lay a gold coin beside her crib to distract and keep the dwarves from kidnapping her, for the dwarves have no women of their own. Better yet one might lay a gem for the dwarves to grant a favor over the young girls life. Often a rich relative will make a present of this and give some small speech asking the children of stone to make a deal and soften the feet of the newborn wherever she may walk. As such their artwork and their clothes are often linked inexorably to the things of the wild. Silver is their favored metal and they will etch it with the signs of satyrs, centaurs or other wild virile spirits (for they value the freedom and moral abandon of these creatures) and sometimes the various languages and secret signs of ancient cultures. These secret signs are generally known to be the works of artists and charlatans, parents know this but still tell children if they can find a way to speak these symbols aloud they will be able to cast spells like the old wizards, without the use of components or rituals. Morgens have lovecraftian/sortofwelsh names (ie R’lyeh). Every Morgen has at least one superstition they believe to be completely true.</p>
<p>The Francs: The francs are a varied group of men and women in many ways. They range from slightly bronzed skin and Grecian features to almost Arabic color and feature. Unlike the wild beards of the saxons or the shaved faces and heads of the moors, the francs fly to neither extreme with their hair and wear mild but highly manicured facial hair. The men are known to use whale grease and musk to comb through their mustaches and beards. It stinks. The Francish families often live in the poorest places throughout Corpathium. Some of the Francish boys sign on to the kings army but there have also been many successful Francish mercenary houses, which to the young boys and their families seem like tickets to a better life. The boys destined for the mercenary houses are taken from their homes at 6-8 years of age. A small fee is paid to the parents. Other times when a boy is a bit too old or is causing trouble or the parents can’t afford him, say at the age of 12-13, the parents will pay the mercenary house instead. Some brothel’s prey upon the young Francish girls in a similar way. There is an old Corpathium folk tale about a young Francish brother and sister. The story goes: The boy is sold to a mercenary house after stealing food for his sister and the sister is bought from the Godless (the police of Corpathium) who took her into custody after the theft. The girl is thrust into life as a courtesan. The boy goes far in his career, eventually becoming the head of his own mercenary house. After all those years he stops in a brothel outside The Golden Wheel where he is surprised to see his sister. He buys her freedom. The story goes on to tell the rest of their tale but this part is the most famous. It is traditional for Francs to conceal a weapon somewhere on themselves, the weapon and location varies from family to family. Francish mercenary houses each have their own weapon and location as well. One of the most famous Francish mercenary houses holds the tradition of men keeping a small razor-blade in their mouths usually pressed against the right cheek. The use and propagation of these weapons stems from mistrust, arrest, and desperation in battle. Francs are “proficient” in their hidden weapon.</p>
