Mountains 
For game purposes, mountainous terrain is devoid of large 
vegetation and usually occurs at high elevation (4,000 feet or 
above). A heavily wooded area on the lower slopes of a mountain 
should be considered as forest, even if the elevation is higher 
than 4,000 feet. A mountainous region (for determination of 
movement, encounters, food availability, etc.) begins where the 
trees end. On Earth, the �tree line� (at about 10,000 feet above 
sea level) marks the place where deciduous growth gives way to 
coniferous trees, which are better suited for survival at higher ele- 
vations and colder temperatures. Beyond the �snow line� 
(12,000 feet), trees cannot prosper, and only low-lying plants and 
shrubs can be found; if characters have not reached mountain- 
ous terrain by the time they�ve climbed this high, they will cer- 
tainly be in mountains if they go any higher. A barren, rocky slope 
that begins at relatively low elevation and rises high above the 
surrounding area can also be considered as mountainous ter- 
rain, even if the base of the slope is lower than 4,000 feet above 
sea level. 
If hills can be described as irregular terrain, then mountains 
are downright chaotic. If there is a level spot to be found on a 
mountainside, it will probably be surrounded on all sides by se- 
vere slopes and vertical or near-vertical cliff faces. Of course, the 
lower slopes of a mountain are much less treacherous than the 
area near the peak - but, as noted above, the lower slopes often 
contain features (usually trees) that require the area to be 
classified as something other than mountainous. 
At any elevation higher than the snow line, some of the rocky 
surface of a mountain will be covered with snow or ice, making 
travel even more hazardous. In contrast, exposed rock surfaces 
at high altitudes can become much warmer than the air tempera- 
ture because they absorb heat from the sun throughout the day 
-and on a mountain, there is no such thing as shade except on a 
slope opposite the sun or in the area beneath an overhang. 
A mountain is a study in contrasts - warm in some places, 
cold in others; practically impossible to climb in some spots, fairly 
easy to negotiate in others; a place of safety or a place of danger, 
depending on your point of view and how well equipped you are 
to deal with the terrain. Not all mountainous areas are inherently 
treacherous, but adventurers who ascend into the peaks without 
proper planning and preparation are either very desperate or 
very foolish.
