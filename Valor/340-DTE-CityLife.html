<h2>Hipsters and Dragons</h2>
<h3>0. Taverns</h3>
Of course.

<h3>1. The Main Square</h3>
<p>One &#8220;like for like&#8221; replacement for the tavern &#8211; maybe the only one &#8211; is a village, town or city&#8217;s main square. The centre of any medieval settlement, the main square was where traders came to sell their goods at market, and it would be full of merchants, nobles, peasants, travellers, bards and other entertainers. It was also the place where politicians delivered speeches and town criers announced news from neighbouring settlements, and would play host to fairs, tournaments, street theatre, parades and other spectacles. It may also have served as a place of executions, and a gathering point during any uprisings and civil unrest. </p>
<p>In other words these market squares were places ripe with adventure, so your PCs will hardly need an excuse to be hanging out here, and you, as the DM, will have plenty of scope to deliver the call to action that kickstarts your adventure. Whether it&#8217;s a creepy soothsayer grabbing a PC with their spindly arm and prophesying a gruesome event, militant clerics arresting a respected civilian for heresy, or a straight forward &#8220;heroes wanted&#8221; announcement bawled aloud by a noble&#8217;s steward, the possibilities are close to endless.</p>

<h3>2. Other Urban Locations</h3>
<p>After a town&#8217;s taverns and market square, there are a few other places which, while not quite as open-ended, could be considered as a potential starting point for a D&#038;D adventure. <b>The docks of a seaside town</b> are a lively meeting point for sailors, gossip mongers, soldiers, custom officers, drunks, merchants, travellers and strange cargo. Pious PCs might be found in a <b>temple</b> (hint: injured fighters tend to develop new found piety, as do poisoned rogues), scholarly parties might have a reason to be in a <b>library</b>, and those with official business might be found in a town hall. A bridge is always an exciting place for a fight to break out. </p>
<p>Obviously larger cities have more potential for creative starting points than small villages, but in this example I want you to think of public spaces that are accessible to the PCs without any pre-conditions. You, or they, might still have to work on why they&#8217;d be there (at the same time). </p>

<h3>3. The Event</h3>
<p>One of my favourite ways to start an adventure is not at a geographical location per se, but at a social &#8216;location&#8217;, i.e. at an event. You hardly need to come up with an excuse for why PCs would be attending a <b>festival, fair or tournament</b>, and after that anything can happen. A princess throws a PC a flower (that has a secret message wrapped around its stem), a wealthy noble is poisoned, a fight breaks out between pro and anti-monarchists, a patron sees potential in the party (after they foil a thief, or win a tournament prize) that will help them achieve their aims, a valuable item goes missing from the town&#8217;s treasure vault and the travelling circus are blamed. Again the possibilities stretch a long way for this one.</p>
<p>Some potential events you could use as starting points would be:</p>
<p>i. Festival (be sure to use some <a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/unique-festivals-around-the-world" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">real life inspiration</a> for what that might entail&#8230; parades, costumes, religious ceremonies, music, drinking, dancing are a good start)<br />
ii. Travelling carnival or circus<br />
iii. (Trade) fair or exposition<br />
iv. Tournament or sporting event<br />
v. Royal wedding<br />
vi. Costume or masked ball<br />
vii. Funeral (for a statesperson or hero)<br />
viii. Speech (announcing a controversial new law)<br />
ix. Execution<br />
x. Uprising or riot</p>
<p>Any of these would lend your world a lot of flavour and make the start of your adventure more memorable than most.</p>


<h2>Bardiches And Bathhouses</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>Old-style Public Houses</b>
        <p>
Over their 6000-year history, most drinking establishments did not look like this. In many cases, "publick houses" (hence, pubs) were simply private homes which were opened to customers seeking victuals and potables, which were usually produced in-house. Oftentimes, these establishments did not have a name, and were simply known as "the house of so-and-so, where you can get something to eat and drink".
        </p>
        <p>
        It may seem like a randexpand point, and perhaps even a poor choice to make establishments less flavorful and memorable by calling them Johnson's instead of the Merry Mermaid. But the differences need not be merely cosmetic. Family-run taverns usually organized space differently than modern bars, which invariably serve as the models in games. If you drank there, you were essentially invited into people's house, into their familial environment. You were in a common area, sitting at tables (or even a single large table) with other patrons, and mingling with the servers, and often, cooks. If the tavern doubled as a hostel or inn, the guests also slept in the common area (or in a shed, with other guests, and not in private rooms made up with beds, chairs, and other hotel furniture short of a TV). There was often little or no division between the areas where the food was prepared and the drinks poured, and the area where the customers consumed what was being served.
        </p>
        <p>
        The atmosphere of such establishments was more intimate. Although money might be exchanged, the visitor was more guest than client. The host's or hostess' family, including children, was usually present. It was significantly more likely that outlandish guests attracted much more attention than they would in a bar, where the only important thing was that they paid with coin. Children could become fascinated with, or frightened of, exotic visitors. Family problems would be much more visible, and the proprietors much more likely to ask powerful-looking strangers for help (without offering much in return). Long-term friendships and intimate relations with family members might arise much more frequently, but so would incidents where a desperate family might murder or rob a wounded adventurer. On the whole, a frequenter of such establishments would more quickly become integrated into the fabric of the local community than the customer in a modern-type bar.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Residence of local ruler</b>
        <p>
        The citadel of the local ruler is also a good place to gather information and offer one's services. Trying to get an audience with the ruler or official isn't the same as going to a bar and spending some coin. It might involve preparation (like buying presentable clothes, or the procurement of gifts, or forging letters of introduction), but the role-playing opportunities at such venues are arguably greater and more varied than in taverns. And coming to know the local notables is another step toward integration in the community.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>The Feast Circuit</b>
        <p>
        Wealthy merchant cities had feast circuits where important people met, hobnobbed, and exchanged intelligence. Those who gathered there wielded influence and had money to spend. As members of the elite, many of them were also skilled combatants, thus privy to knowledge about expeditions and adventure. Getting invited to a feast wasn't easy if you were an unknown or a new arrival, but trying to gain admittance by performing in public, or pretending you were a foreign prince could sometimes result in an invitation. If that didn't work, hiring oneself out as a servant could get you in the door, where you could then overhear all kinds of things. How often are adventurers in the position of servants, instead of customers? Why aren't they? As a variant, VIPs can also get together in a bathhouse; it would really change things up to have an encounter there, rather than in a bar.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><b>Caravansarai</b>
        <p>
        A caravansarai (if such an institution exists in your world) is another place where information about interesting locales, or even work as a caravan guard can be acquired. With their open-air layout, mysterious alcoves, and beguiling stories by mysterious foreigners, they provide a very different feel from the typical tavern.
        </p>

<h3>Shops</h3>

<ol>
<li>Madame Ortho&#8217;s Oddities: A curiosity shop that sells useful (sometimes cursed) trinkets. Examples of some of her wares: a mummy hand that tries to strange it&#8217;s owner while they sleep, a compass that points to the person that hates the owner the most, and a stuffed Vargouille.</li>
<li>The Cobbler: A store that sells all kinds of horseshoes, for all kinds of reasons, but you notice, this town has no horses. </li>
<li>A Man&#8217;s Burden: A blacksmith who displays and sells exotic weapons, made using blueprints gathered from across the land. </li>

<li>Fran&#8217;s fortuitous froths: potions of dubious origins and craftsmanship, they almost never work as advertised, but always help you in a way you didn&#8217;t know you need. </li>
<li>Sofie&#8217;s softies: pillows of the highest quality, stuffed with feathers of magic beasts, and enchanted with various effects. </li>
<li>All the RAGE: battle axes and fashionable shirts. </li>
<li>Wrench warfare: magic craftsman tools that can change into weapons. Great for sneaking weaponry past the border or into the castle. You can place custom orders. </li>
<li>Caesarean&#8217;s Palace &#8211; &#8220;Veni Vidi Veni&#8221;: The strip club on the bad side of town. </li>
<li>Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes: A store ran by a mysterious wizard, it only sells human appendages. </li>
<li>The Lotto Grotto: A store that sells magical items, but the item could be cursed or enchanted, and the buyer only knows after using it once. </li>
<li>Gertrude&#8217;s Trinkets:A dingy magic shop on a back street that sells surprisingly good (we&#8217;re talking some top notch stuff here) magic weapons and trinkets for ridiculously low prices (half the price of normal on average). At midnight anything bought from the shop returns back to the shop magically, and the shop teleports to another remote location. </li>
<li>The Satyr&#8217;s Pact: A tavern run by a satyr who offers musicians a deal. If they impress him and the crowd with a song they earn a instrument that is always in tune and free room and board for life. If they fail, they work in his tavern for a decade but can audition again for the same deal, years do add up. </li>
<li>Rock Candy: Sells and buys a wide variety of gemstones. The shopkeeper is an Oread who has a tendency to eat the product, much to the dismay of the shop owner.  </li>
<li>Scrumdidilyumptious: This bakery is owned by a sorcerer whose focus is on her craft. She likes to infuse her goodies with spells, from rainbow cookies that make your tongue temporarily a new color to a slice of chili cake that makes your fire spells scarily more potent for a while. </li>
<li>Munsters R Us: A tiny Pug stands at a crate, hollering in broken common to come over. He&#8217;ll buy your scavenged monster parts (albeit at varying prices) from you. If you give him enough, he&#8217;ll turn them into an item. It&#8217;s disturbing, but how can you resist his cute lil&#8217; face? </li>
<li>Furever Homes: Offers small and under-sized creatures as animal companions and pets. They have the basics, like rats, spiders, etc., but if you have enough money, you could adopt more exotic creatures. </li>
<li>The Mountaineer&#8217;s Bandolier: Sells survival kits, potions that help you adapt to weather, and various supplies that help explorers get through tough climate situations. </li>
<li>Fizzlesprocket&#8217;s Dairiticiary: A quirky gnome runs this ice cream stand and tries to pawn off bizarre treats. You won&#8217;t know if you like it till you try it. </li>
<li>Blood letting: general store takes payments in different kinds of blood. </li>

<li>Fallen from a star: A well known bar/pub can find different celebritie style characters like Worgen Freeman or Clint Westwood. </li>
<li>Seamus the Imp Peddler: A travelling peddler, riding a covered cart led by a mule, stops by the party. He explains that he specialises in the sale of imps, but so far the only ones he has been able to obtain (trade secrets and all) have limited lifespans. It&#8217;s a mixed bag in his opinion so all the imps cost the same. Imps cost [1d20/1.33] GP each, half this if it&#8217;s raining. On purchase the imp is bound to the character until the imp&#8217;s unique demise. Each imp has a craving and a fear; if the character is helpful in these regards the imp&#8217;s loyalty will improve. Each imp also holds a secret agenda of mischief. </li>
<li>Herb the Hatters: Herb makes exquisitely beautiful hats which are quite uncomfortable. </li>
<li>The Transport Tube: Any common item will fall down from a tube from above, assuming something of value has been put in the slot in the cubicle. Approx 5ft square circle room. Out the back, some creatures would be feeding the items in. </li>
<li>Murray&#8217;s Theatrics: The half-elf Murray retired from the life of a wandering bard eight years ago, but still loves the trade dearly. His shop (which is really just the anteroom to his house) stocks sheet music and scripts for the lutist looking to expand her repertoire, or the troupe seeking to get ahead of the new fashion in comedies. The texts cost next to nothing &#8211; Murray remembers what it&#8217;s like to travel on a performer&#8217;s income. The real money comes from his younger brother, Astor, whose potions create audience-dazzling special effects. </li>
<li>The Furrowed Brow: Esmeralda Turnbottom&#8217;s mother made wards, and her mother made wards, and her mother made wards&#8230; And Esme has never been one to spoil a good tradition. The wares range from mundane (a pendant against forgetfulness, carved from gingko bark) to the specialized (ground cat&#8217;s tooth to drive off harpies). Once a year, she closes up shop for a much deserved vacation, and returns with an armful of oddly specific wards. Such as &#8220;protection from a stampede of your own cattle frightened by a thunderclap on a moonless summer night&#8221;. And yet they always get bought, and they always end up useful&#8230; </li>
<li>The Sizzler: An exotic restaurant run by a very jovial, and very fat, half-ogre named Thog. They specialize in rare meats of all kinds and will pay well if what you have is fresh. From drake wings to spider legs, if it&#8217;s fresh and serviceable they&#8217;ll buy it. Their meals are renowned for being tasty and surprisingly filling, and the exotic nature of their ingredients has been known to impart certain temporary boons to the consumer. The house special is constantly changing, so get in quick before the line forms! </li>
<li>Nero&#8217;s Place: A shop run by an aging, paranoid neurotic elf that is convinced there&#8217;s a demon after him. Nero sells a wide assortment of scrying crystals, mirrors, looking glasses, and patented listening tools that he uses on a daily basis. Some of his inventions are actually helpful, like his &#8216;Peek-around&#8217; that angles two mirrors inside a square tube to look around corners. Others are less helpful, like his &#8216;Hearing Helm&#8217; that is basically two gramophone bells welded onto a bucket. He also sells protective charms and wards to help keep&#8230; well anything off your back, really. For the paranoid inside us all, Nero&#8217;s Place is the Place for you! </li>
<li>Goldie&#8217;s Locks: a wig shop selling enchanted wigs that are just right. </li>
<li>The &#8220;ooks&#8221; Store: A dingy store front window displays &#8220;ooks&#8221; peeling gold lettering. Inside the dimly lit shop are shelves upon shelves of musty old volumes fill up the space until only narrow paths await the adventurous customer. After searching the store you might find what you want&#8230;or need in the future. </li>
<li>The Amazing Omar&#8217;s Shop of Curiosities: Omar, a flamboyantly dressed merchant waves, you over to his display wagon to view his wears. Various charms, potions, knick-knacks, and unguents are on display for all to see. If you are a polite and interested customer he may be persuaded to showcase his more interesting items&#8230; </li>
<li>Adon&#8217;s Exceptional Reflection Collection: A good sized shop that sells mirrors of various shapes and sizes, run by a reclusive and eccentric old gnome named Adon. Mirrors hang from almost every surface, with some even dangling from the ceiling or the bottom of other mirrors. It is incredibly easy to get lost wandering the store, and the inside seems significantly bigger than its outside appearance belies. An observant customer will notice that some mirrors occasionally reflect fantastic locations with startling realism. </li>
<li>Ketterman Barley&#8217;s Stonecarving and Statuary: Ketterman is a stone carver of some renown, and does all kinds of stonework from bas-reliefs and fountains to statues and headstones. He&#8217;s expanded his business recently by offering smaller, personal busts of the client for a reasonable sum, depending on the quality of the stone. Ketterman typically sells to the upper class, but as long as you can pay he&#8217;s more than willing to work with just about any customer. But here&#8217;s the catch: Ketterman is actually an accomplished diviner as well. Every time he carves an eye into his stonework he can use those eyes to scry through at any time. Ketterman uses his vast network of eyes to spy on anyone within their gaze, and if he comes across something particularly noteworthy he sells that knowledge to the highest bidder, or uses it as leverage for blackmail under his assumed alias of &#8216;The Emerald Pool&#8217; (because his eyes are green). Ketterman has been operating for almost two decades now, and his work has traveled far across the land. Odds are his stone eyes have seen something you didn&#8217;t want to be seen. So tell me friend; what are you hiding? </li>
<li>Blood Of Thy Enemies/Blood Of My Blood: Half the shop weapons &#038; instruments of death run by tiny, aggressive woman. The other half a healing shop run by a large barbarian type man who&#8217;s gentle. They are a couple&#8230;opposites attract? </li>
<li>Rats, Bats, &#038; Vats: Your typical cauldron witch type store. Alchemy, herbs, could be run by hag. </li>
<li>Kern The Hammer&#8217;s Hammers: Shout out to Critical Role. Half-Orc Kern The Hammer has given up on fighting in the pits after the loss to Grog the Barbarian, the shop has every kind of hammer you could ask for. </li>
<li>Maybe It&#8217;s Adamantine: A clearance type shop of magical items. Genuine as advertised Magical Items are in stock but rare. Lots of faulty or completely misidentified items. Create any additional rules, such as refund any item after purchase but at 30% of it&#8217;s value, no identify spells allowed on store premises, etc. </li>
<li>Ninth Level: Hell themed. Run by a demon or devil. Opportunity to buy existing contracts or forge a new one. </li>
<li>Mendelsen&#8217;s Magnificent Mending: Mendlesen is the most talented mender in the world. Clothes, artifacts, magic items, you name it &#038; he/she can mend it. </li>
<li>Carts &#038; Crafts: Every kind of vehicle for sale &#038; rent. Can purchase passage on different methods of transportation as well. Purchases come with option to register as a transporter to provide passage &#038; collect fares. </li>
<li>Dark Arts &#038; Melted Hearts: Your typical &#8220;Dark Arts&#8221; type store, but complete with a tavern type meeting area that regularly provides a speed dating-esque environment for undesirables, villians, &#038; general ne&#8217;er-do-wells. Everyone deserves a shot a love right? </li>
<li>The Dock of Many Flings: A store either on the water or with a large well inside. There are no items, only shelves and shelves of pebbles worth different tiers of gold. You buy a pebble, then stand over the designated area and cast your pebble into the water. You gain a random magical effect, item, or etc. (eg. A Mini or alternate deck of many things) </li>
<li>Whispers &#038; Secrets: The only goods bought and sold here are rumors, secrets, other generally unknown information. You cannot pay with traditional currency, must offer hidden information of your own to barter with. Use either an unbiased magical system (such as speaking your secret into a glass jar, putting the lid on placing upon a magical scale that determines it&#8217;s weight/value), or for more interesting roleplaying opportunities have a totally biased shopkeep the players can haggle with or try and persuade. </li>
<li>Proctor &#038; Son&#8217;s Deadly Traps: More a small dungeon than a store, the ceiling to floor to finally the basement is covered in traps. You must survive long enough to actually disarm and then purchase your chosen traps. It used to be a family business but that didn&#8217;t last for very long. </li>
<li>Impeccable Times: In a building stylized as a home befitting a cuckoo clock, the sound of ticking from countless mechanisms dominate the senses. The blind elderly craftsman shows no concern for anyone except his owl which is never far from his side. Secretly, he can hear from every watch and see from every clock he creates. The owl is also a mechanical contraption. </li>
<li>Ayesha&#8217;s Insult Emporium: The store&#8217;s name, in simple black lettering, is all that infers what lies inside. A friendly middle aged woman (presumably Ayesha) wearing a sari greets customers entering this store&#8217;s antechamber with a sharp personal insult. Anyone who takes great offense to the insult is teleported out of the shop and can&#8217;t re-enter. However, those who accept it in good spirit will be led by Ayesha to the main room which contains shelves and cabinets filled with scrolls, books and scraps of paper containing some of the most brilliant, sought-after and mind-bending insults to ever have been uttered or penned. </li>
<li>The Green Room: This inn, hidden by an entrance in the sewers, provides lodging in rooms made completely of thick glass. The floors consist of different types of soil, and beds are constructed from clay with meagre hay mattresses. Patrons that stay the night develop a slight green tinge to their skin that persists for a week. For this duration, as long as one stays in direct natural sunlight for at least 4 hours a day, they need not eat. Sleep is required as usual, and water requirements per day to survive are doubled. </li>
<li>The Potato Is Just An Illusion: A comedy club and tavern frequented by illusionists, diviners and enchanters. Patrons dine, drink and listen to wizards from the local guild tell comedy that is usually highly academic in nature and augmented by various creative illusions. STRICTLY NO IMP FAMILIARS ALLOWED. </li>
<li>Piander&#8217;s Books: A poorly lit bookshop filled with books of ancient lore. Run by a seemingly mute man in a dark cloak, he watches visitors closely from the shadows. </li>
<li>Alethra&#8217;s Tear Shop: A medium sized store with shelves full of tiny bottles of tears, the are all carefully labeled with the date the tears were shed, the name and race of the being that shed them, and the reason they were shed. Run by a middle aged woman named Alethera, an unusually cheerful woman who is as eager to buy new tears as she is to sell them. Alethera is especially interested in the tears of adventures and famous people. </li>
<li>Adventure&#8217;s Emporium: On the outside it looks abandoned and if you ask around town you will be told it is cursed or haunted, but when adventures enter the building they enter a spacious, well lit store full of ten foot poles, iron spikes, torches, and other adventuring gear. It is run by a retired adventurer. </li>
<li>Darvin&#8217;s Dandy Dolls: A shop with shelves full of dolls, many of them resemble important political figures of the region. It is rumored that some of the dolls have power over the people they represent. </li>
<li>Sprog&#8217;s Spirits: A dark shop run by a well tempered and grim half orc. It&#8217;s shelves are filled with bottles that Sprog claims hold the spirits of the dead. </li>
<li>Anton&#8217;s All-porpoise Absolutions: An office run by a cleric of a god of mercy. A place where kings and commoners alike go to repair their relationship with their gods and other extraplanar patrons. </li>
<li>Magroma&#8217;s Jewelry: A &#8220;jewelry store&#8221; run by an old woman where all of the jewelry is made out of the polished bones of various creatures, some of them quite exotic. </li>
<li>Arcadia Glass: A small shop with shelves filled with tiny and exquisitely beautiful glass statues. Run by a half elf, behind his desk he has a small collection of graphic statues that appear to depict past and future events. </li>
<li>Gulthric&#8217;s Curiosity Shoppe: A mostly nondescript store from the outside, this shop is run by an old copper dragonborn. The inside of the shop is sectioned off with all sorts of magical items for sale, and there is the slight smell of incense. The shopkeeper will sell magic items in trade for a true story. The more important the story is to the character, the more likely they are to receive a more powerful magic item (limited within DM&#8217;s reason, of course). Magic items range from a large selection of small trinkets to a rather limited selection of powerful items. </li>
<li>Fletcher&#8217;s Hunting Goods: A traveling fletcher who makes high quality bows and arrows. More likely to be seen in a frontier town or on the trails in the wilderness. </li>
<li>Clara&#8217;s Haberdashery: a half-orc woman makes and sells fashionable hats to normal patrons, but sells magical hats on the black market. Her hats are imbued with special abilities by using rare and wonderful items. She&#8217;s an artist to her core and she&#8217;ll try to accommodate your request, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s her final word. Imagine wild versions of hats you know, precursors to hats we have now, but much more ornate and fanciful.</li>
<li>People, People!: It&#8217;s a shop where you can hire people. There&#8217;s different races and strengths of people for different prices. You can hire a commoner for 1 gold as usual, but there&#8217;s a few stronger people, or twin halflings that come as a bundle, or an old lady that&#8217;s very expensive. There&#8217;s not usually shops where you can easily hire people. Here one is. </li>
<li>The Flying Dutchmans&#8217; Insurance Agency: A pair of brothers, The Dutchmans, enchant items to levitate back to a predetermined location after using a keyword. Useful for if an item is stolen. </li>

<li>A butcher shop carries all types of exotic meats. If you ask for last week&#8217;s special they will show their true product, meat from the humanoid races.</li>
<li>Notch-me-own-pegleg Dibbloor&#8217;s pie cart. Once a pirate on the high seas, with the loss of his leg Dibbloor turned entrepreneurial. He can be found near any crowd pushing his cart and haggling his wares. He&#8217;s sold many things (not all of which were his), but his specialty has always been rat pie. &#8216;Fresh off the ships!&#8217; He says, and despite making most sick, it&#8217;s a staple food at any gathering. &#8216;I&#8217;ll give you two for three dubloons, and tha&#8217;s notchin me own pegleg, tha&#8217; is.&#8217;</li>

<li>Arcadia&#8217;s candles: a green haired elf woman sells candles that have potions mixed into the wax. If you light a candle then the effect of the potion it&#8217;s infused with begins to take place over the duration of the candle burning, and affects everyone that can smell it.</li>
<li>Mother Gimble&#8217;s &#8211; A small old woman, bent and ancient, whose race cannot be determined, leads her overloaded wagon with a cantankerous donkey in the most remote places of the world. She always has precisely the items the party needs in stock, even if the item can&#8217;t possibly have been found by her (a key for the right door, water in the desert, that phoenix feather you need for your rejuvenation potion). In exchange for these items, she takes no gold but instead insists on telling each person their fortune, which is always something as terrible as the item is important to you.</li>
<li>Cobb&#8217;s Stalls &#8211; A dapper human named Cobb sells equipment for market stall creation and operation.</li>
<li>The Pouch &#8211; A spell component place that also serves as a hangout for magicians to talk shop, swap spells, and make connections.</li>

<li>Dann&#8217;s Furnace &#8211; A relatively slim half-orc sells winterwear and climbing gear. His Special Hand Furnaces can provide heat for a tent and are recharged whenever the holder casts a fire spell.</li>
<li>Starlight&#8217;s Lost Wish- A white Aarakocra runs a large, eclectic stall. Once, upon being granted a wish by the genie Vur&#8217;nnon, Starlight wished for limitless wishes.

Making the best of a bad situation, Starlight has a permanent sale.</li>
<li>The Unencumbring &#8211; An elf named Cavea Tvenditor &#8216;sells nothing, buys anything&#8217;. She offers a nearly fair price for all offerings. Anyone selling more than 3 things at a time must make a Wisdom Saving Throw or also sell something they didn&#8217;t intend to part with (an item, a memory, etc-DMs choice). The person realizes 1d4 minutes after leaving the shop, and Cavea does not let go of bargains easily&#8230;</li>
<li>The Satyr&#8217;s Pipe &#8211; Giles of Sorania sells flowers, perfume, gifts, and sweets. For the lovelorn, he will also (for high prices) sell scrolls of randexpand illusion, diodems of charisma, and &#8216;virility and fertility aids&#8217;. If asked correctly, Giles also has charm person and domination spells for the right price&#8230;</li>

<h3>Guilds</h3>
(DnD Speak)

<ol>
<li>The Salty Dogs: A mercenary guild that specializes in maritime activities. Crew for hire, protection of merchant vessels, dock security, etc. You can find a Salty Dogs guildhall in any city with a port. They recruit all types, but their primary composition is of the more physically inclined. Everyone has to pull their weight on a ship.</li>
<li>Disciples of Trastor: Almost more of a cult than a guild, the Disciples of Trastor follow the teachings of an ancient necromancer, rumored to have been the first Lich. Their practices are, of course, veiled in secrecy, as Necromancy is generally frowned upon, but every tavern usually has one drunk who claims to know all about their secret rituals&#8230;. heard from a completely reliable and not at all suspect chain of sources.</li>
<li>Nightblades: A guild for the more violently inclined roguish types. Small, but widespread. From intimidation to assassination, the Nightblades have you covered.</li>
<li>Hinterland Paragons: A religious order who follow the patron deity of travelers and pilgrims, the Hinterland Paragons are dedicated to keeping the roads safe for travelers of all faiths.</li>
<li>Order of the Shattered Helm: A guild sworn to follow in the legacy of an ancient hero, slain in battle. The Order is host to many paladins, clerics, war clerics, and fighters. They take on only just causes, and claim their reward from fallen foes. They constantly search for relics of the fallen hero.</li>
<li>Cult of the Eternal Dragon: A group of sorcerers and warlocks devoted to finding the next vessel of the Eternal Dragon, a deity they claim is trapped in a mortal form, doomed to be reincarnated as a mundane being over and over until his followers can find him and break his curse. Most regard the Cult as a collection of crackpots, but what if they&#8217;re right?</li>
<li>The Sons of the Sword: A guild of knights dedicated to mastery of swordplay. They take mostly noble sons, but those with enough of a reputation may be able to secure membership. The Sons accept quests based on political gain, and are constantly maneuvering for ever more power among the elite. And they don&#8217;t come cheap, either.</li>
<li>Purple Pansies: One of the longest-standing guilds, the Pansies are well respected and quite proud of their heritage, which is very serious and not all silly. The tale seems slightly different every time it is told, however. The Pansies are almost always seen in their ostentatious formal uniform, gratuitously bedecked in brightly colored ribbons and polished medals. (Seriously, though, the founder did participate extensively in a resistance against an occupying army. It just wasn&#8217;t very well documented.)</li>
<li>The Aeternal Academy: A group of wizards dedicated to lofty study and ideals of knowledge for knowledge&#8217;s sake. Masters of magical theory, not always great with practical application.</li>
<li>Divers of the Deep: An adventuring guild specialized in spelunking and dungeon diving. Not for the claustrophobic.</li>
<li>The Fatherless Sons: a guild of former squires whose knights fell in battle, who had to make their own way in the world.</li>
<li>The Shepherds: A guild dedicated to protecting the common folk from danger. Take a tithe from their members&#8217; loot to offset costs for those who seek their aid.</li>
<li>The Fuster Cluck Cabal: Sure, you can keep up to five hens in your backyard for breakfast egg production, but you get that sixth chicken and don&#8217;t tithe to the cabal, you&#8217;re going to be real sorry. They have a stranglehold on chicken/egg production in town: good quality birds and eggs, but pricey. They live like kings.</li>
<li>Gourmet Gorget: A society of cooking professionals. In a world of hungry adventurers and monsters, someone has to prepare the dishes to sustain and liven up a party. And who knows, rare ingredients in dangerous places don&#8217;t collect themselves!</li>
<li>Society of Former Healers: This group of disenfranchised healers, abused by adventurers, have banded together. They learned the sacred art of healing for undead destruction or for precise calculations of death, not to cure the first idiot who thought jumping off a 50 foot cliff to &#8216;ride the giant crow to the ground&#8217; was a good idea.</li>
<li>Experiment X: A guild dedicated to the advancement of science, for and only for science sake. There are no limits to what members of this guild will do just to see what might happen. The guild accepts members of any race/class as any good experiment needs a wide sample size. Members of Experiment X can be known by the large green X patch that they wear on their personal garb, although often you will know they are a member of the guild before you see the patch, whether it be by the extra appendages, copious glowing boils, or an ever present burning smell.</li>
<li>Syndicate of the Hammer/Camaraderie of the Sickle: Secret guilds of city and farm workers (respectively) usually found on big cities, working to make the worker&#8217;s lives a little better, including paying warriors to protect the people during strikes and even assassins to try to kill bosses/leaders/royalty if they&#8217;re known to exploit their subjects.</li>
<li>The Flying Dragoons: Once a powerful independent fighting force for a civil war long past. This guild comprises of skilled pilots of the skies. Many members are dirigible and airship captains, in fact it is hard pressed to find a skilled pilot or captain that isn&#8217;t a part of this prestigious group. Dedicated to the freedom and clarity of the skies, Flying Dragoon&#8217;s have no problems speaking their mind, and many are quite vocal about being committed to fighting tyranny if the need ever again arose. Most just view this as idle talk however as commuting adventurers around the skies can often be a long and lonely task.</li>
<li>Fellowship of the Bling: A group of jewelers, varying in race and class, focused on creating the most extravagant pieces of jewelry known throughout the world. Their founder, Sir Laurence Tureaud, is know for keeping his hair in a mohawk, a career as a member of the B-Team, and wearing so many heavy, ostentatious gold pendants and amulets, that he now walks hunched over.</li>
<li>Harlequins: An assassin&#8217;s guild, going into every job like they&#8217;re stepping onto stage, a smile or a snarl on their face to fit their role. Each Harlequin is deadly, but they work together in troupes, led by Solitaires that are some of the most dangerous individuals in the world.</li>
<li>The Keepers: It&#8217;s only member is Gerry (or is it?), the crazy homeless guy on the corner, but he will tell you and anyone who will listen that they number in the thousands and are the most powerful secret society in the verse. A tribute paid to him will ensure you good favor and that the Keepers will watch your back.</li>
<li>Carrion Crows: The garbage collectors of major cities, traveling armies and outer regions. They collect, burn and remove refuse in all its forms. They work closely with assassins guild in disposing of bodies and thieves guilds with finding homes with wealthy residents (who knows more than the goon going through your garbage).

<li>The Augerers: Because even your fantasy setting needs weathermen.</li>
<li>The Vixen Syndicate: A well organized guild of highly trained escorts and confidantes for hire who specialize in finding secrets out about their clients. Used as spies and information gathering. They can also be used to disseminate information, gossip, or lies, to those they work with to pass on to their clients. They have no government affiliation and often have a member in every place people of power go for comfort. It is advisable to pay promptly and often tip for their services as any failure to pay for services rendered will lead to the hiring person being ruined, disgraced, or having the same mission done to them free of charge.</li>
<li>Golden Griffin Guild: Once a big and prosperous guild spanning their work through many nations, supporting and training many adventurers, they had their castle destroyed by plague magic and now ,the few members left, live in a dilapidated tavern in a rural town. The Guildmaster, Svetlana Trigg, a middle Aged Wood Elf, still receives requests from the local populace, but unable to fill them will pass the quests to any of the tavern&#8217;s patrons who are interested in some easy cash. People close to her also say that she has maps of local abandoned dungeons and fortresses, including one of the old Golden Griffin Castle, now plagued with blight, surrounded by poisonous bogs and home to all kind of evil and pestilence, but still, filled with the treasures of adventurers who wintered there.</li>
<li>The Lightning Hooves: Guild of all types of transporters, riders, and drivers of all kinds. Emphasis on speed, they are the ones to call if you need a message delivered swiftly, a package transported securely, a ride through dangerous territory, or just need someone who can pilot/ride a vehicle or mount to an expert ability.</li>
<li>Tree-buchets: A siege crafter guild dedicated to the finest siege weapon ever made: The Trebuchet. For some reason the guild is heavily themed after trees&#8230; Rivals to the Cat-apults.</li>

<li>The Justichars: a chain of slaughterhouses that specialize in beef products. Their signature product? The charred ground beef patty served on a bun with a leafy green to boot. The individuals in the guild are referred to as &#8216;burgers&#8217;&#8230; Whatever that means.</li>
<li>The Namesayers: A guild of scribes, tailors, and artists. Want to start your own guild but can&#8217;t think of a cool name to stand out among the Flying Dragoons or the Nightblades? Come to us, give us some details on your guild and founding members, and we&#8217;ll come up with a name for you! We also do crests and tabards.</li>
<li>The Sirens: An elite group of bards who meet once a year to complete and share new skills. Each year, the 3 High Callers &#8211; those in charge &#8211; get a Silver Note, a silver pin in the shape of a music note, to award to one bard. This allows them to join the next annual meeting, getting them through the advanced wards and spend surrounding the site each year.</li>
<li>The Hoard: A group of various races who work for a beholder known as The Collector, trading artifacts or knowledge for secrets and information. (Personally, I&#8217;d call the members &#8216;Hoarders&#8217;)</li>
<li>The Ceaseless Bloom: A group of farms and coops run by druids and rangers who manipulate growth times to produce large amounts of crops all year.</li>
<li>The Silver Lions: A three branched guild of mercenaries ran by fraternal twin Tieflings, and their human half brother, which take many different contracts for their services, often offering reduced pricing for quests that have them searching out powerful artifacts. The twins work together for now, but one seems to always have the harder contracts to fulfill, against their better judgement.</li>
<li>The Heirs of Xor-Kumbukquan: This guild is a trail of refugees who survived a subterran battle around the already perilously conflicted dwarf city Xor-Kumbukquan in which the drow defeated the dwarf army that stood watch. This specific guild of dwarfs dared venture to the surface world in order to plan the recapture of their home city. They are, for dwarf standards, open to new things and even allowed other races to join their guild, which they originally registered to have weight in surfacer politics. Now some dwarfs catch themselves thinking about dwelling on the surface forever. The dwarfes are apparently about to split up into different groups again, re-creating the fate of Xor-Kumbukquan. Some disagree with letting other races join, some want to become mountain dwarves and get even higher into the mountains. They are expert miners and sell coal and small amounts of valuable materials found under the earth. Also their elders know the drows plans to expand and eventually start raids against human settlements at night.</li>

<li>The Spotless: This guild began as simply members of a city&#8217;s street cleaning crew. However, over time they began accepting coin in order to clean up some adventuring party&#8217;s misadventures. When a team of adventures have an encounter go sideways and need to dispose of evidence, bodies, or clean a crime scene it will be The Spotless that they call upon.</li>
<li>Embertenders: Viewed as a �guiding light� type of organization from anyone on the outside, this Guild serves a wildly different purpose known to the dwarves whose strongholds are lucky enough to support a branch. Primarily, they are fire mages charged with keeping those bastard trees from burrowing in and destroying their craftwork and tunnels, whether it be root-ine maintenance or clear cutting forests around growing settlements before or during development.</li>
<li>The NPC&#8217;s: A guild of meta-knowledge truthers who recognize that there is something off in the world. For example, why does everybody always stand 5 feet apart from one another?</li>
<li>The Denizens of the Endless Void: Members of this organization call themselves &#8216;listeners.&#8217; They are dedicated to contacting and uncovering life on other planes. Not appropriate to all settings, but possibly great for irony in settings where extra-planar creatures are relatively common.</li>
<li>The Contenders: Your local fantasy organizers, rule-creators, and sometimes inventors of non-combat sports.</li>
<li>The Spice Traders: No need to be coy or mince words. These merchants pay well for exotic spices, reagents, and herbs.</li>

<li>The Court of Miracles: A group of shapeshifters, changelings, illusionists and the like who infiltrate other guilds and high ranking positions to gather private information, whether it be for personal/guild gain or blackmail. Anonymity is highly valued by the members and as such they usually communicate with untraceable or cryptic messages. Entry is only through anonymous invitation and the cost is a valuable secret which can benefit the guild members. The guild motto is &#8216;We are no one&#8230;and everyone&#8230;&#8217;.</li>
<li>Golden Road Caravan Company: Works with independent artisans and guilds to transport goods between settlements in the local province. Also buying goods that are cheap and taking them to high-demand areas for extra profits. They run a set of wagons and cart trains, with a crews of drivers, guards, and extra hands to load and unload goods, along with a guild representative.</li>
<li>The Brokers: Technically a form of indentured servitude, it is a government-run guild that is considered a respectable form of repaying your debts to other citizens and to society with strict regulations protecting the worker.

They ride on horseback, or whatever mount suits them and carry pole arms and long weapons. Their ranks mostly includes Paladins, Clerics, Fighters, and Rangers but anyone of good intention is more than welcome to join so long as they are willing to pledge allegiance to Tyr and uphold justice over self-held beliefs. Oh, and their horses are equipped with horseshoes of waterwalking.</li>
<li>The Glass Eyes: A small group of elite wizards specializing in scrying. Need to find a person or object? Pony up enough coin and they�ll look for you. Very stingy with their services and what they consider is worth their time.</li>
<li>The Honorable Profession of the Clothier: While they do not mind people mending their own clothes, or children wearing hand-me-downs, they are remarkably proactive about ensuring no one else makes clothes. These tailors and seamstresses demand to inspect all cloth and clothing sold within their territory. Anyone caught making clothes or worse, counterfeiting HPC tags, finds out the hard way that people who sew tend to own multiple variants on the theme of scissors.</li>

<li>The Royal Zoological Society: Dedicated to identifying, cataloging, and describing all living things.</li>
<li>The Red Wolf Hunters semi-legal professional bounty hunters. These warrior-trackers work alone, and are recognized the world over as the names to call when an individual needs to be apprehended alive.</li>
<li>The Order of the Silent Temple: A society of monks, clerics, and bards dedicated to cataloging and studying forgotten religions. They don&#8217;t profess to seek to bring these god&#8217;s worship back into the world, but their archives are an invaluable resource to adventurers (and cultists&#8230;) of all kinds.</li>
<li>The Shrikes: A group of assassins they say cannot be hired, and no one can reliably say how to contact them. They are known only by their kills, which are all very distinct. The Shrikes only target people who abuse the law for their own ends. Those who act &#8216;lawfully&#8217;, but are wholly unethical.

<li>The Sisters of Stone: A multi-purpose guild primarily composed of Dwarf women, the Sisters work in adventuring, stonecraft, brewing, smithing, and more.

<li>The Iron Circle: A group of mages dedicated to guarding against the dangers of magic. They understand that with power comes temptation, and they dedicate themselves to policing the magical community and researching ways to detect, resist, and fight the threats specific to magic-users. Their intentions are good, but not appreciate their efforts, and sometimes the methods of some members fall into definite gray territory.</li>
<li>The Street Worker&#8217;s Action Guild: A loose conglomerate formed to organize and protect all those who ply their trade on the streets. From traveling merchants to street performers to women(and men!) of the night to your favorite meat-on-a-stick vendor, SWAG makes sure that everyone gets access to the choicest corners equally. The guild also records any reports of harassment or mistreatment by any other organization, and pressures them accordingly. Just make sure you pay your dues&#8230; It&#8217;s amazing how quickly your sales can dry up.</li>
<li>The Wave Breakers A loose collection of human armadas, merfolk, and powerful marine entities that guard the ports of important trade cities from the many threats of the deep.</li>

<li>Corvin&#8217;s Tears: Bodies tend to pile up around cities and are not often disposed of properly. This guild collects bodies from off the streets and execution grounds, then gives them the burial rites of a handful of common gods before disposal. The most common method is cremation.

The guild also keeps large flocks of enchanted carrion crows that patrol the surrounding countryside for forgotten bodies or in extreme cases rip and tear unholy animated flesh to pieces.</li>
<li>Overland Express: Sometimes you need to send a message, but those pesky wizards are just. so. expensive! Overland Express is the budget-friendly way to get your message from A to B. Though sometimes less reliable than other methods, they&#8217;re still a household name in most of the world.</li>
<li>The Royal Bird Watching Society: if you are dreaming of sitting alongside tranquil rivers watching the graceful dance of migrating birds then this is not the guild for you, as only the most diehard and adventurous birdwatchers choose to join the RBWS. Perhaps one of the most ruthless and blood thirsty guilds in the land, the RBWS&#8217;s annual bird watching competation see&#8217;s adventurous birdwatchers competing to find some of the most far flung, exotic and dangerous birds in the world. But it is not the many feathered fiends that appear on the annual list that makes this guild so dangerous, but rather the extreme and often homicidal lengths your fellow guild members will go to to ensure they win the prize.</li>
<li>Bureau for the Conservation and Management of Magical and Mundane Wildlife: With so many different kids of magical game and varied hunting methods the job of wildlife management is unending. From regulating hunting lodges to fining local necromancers for letting their creations feast on animal these surprisingly bureaucratic druids, rangers, and even clerics keep the forests well stocked and healthy.</li>

<li>The Torchers: Once a vile group of nighttime marauders, but now a respectable group of escorts and tour guides that use preventive measures and escape tactics to keep their customers alive from the freaks and scares of the world.</li>
<li>Scroungers: A group of people looking to teach the homeless, poor, or whomever is curious how to find food wherever they go: which spotted mushrooms are good to eat, and which will cause your skin to rot. How long can a banana sit in the trash before it&#8217;s considered inedible? Which roots should be boiled, which should be ground, and which should be left out to dry to attract green beetles: which make for a great paste on old toast. Great for aspiring adventurers, those who find it difficult to make or keep coin, and those who are thrifty and curious!</li>
<li>The fishing district of &#8216;town name&#8217;: orcs that seem like reformed, civilized fishermen, but when they sail, its 10% actual fishing, 90% fighting sea beasts to protect the kingdom and relieve orcish agressive tension. (Evil version: they raid Triton villiges)</li>

Members of the coalition and most of their honorary members are granted safe passage through most Treant forests. Consequentially, most coalition outposts make their required dues to their regional guild through selling out their services as guides through Treant forests and educators of Treant culture. Due to their deep connections with nature, natural magic, and the wilderness, most members of the coalition come from druidic and necessity-hunter backgrounds�the former making up the the educator workforce and the latter making up most of the �Park Ranger� workforce.</li>
<li>The Old Constabulary: When a new lord moves in, sometimes he wants to put new laws in place. Guardsmen/Police that refuse to go against their long standing principles for trivial things such as a temporary new boss, will generally be unceremoniously dropped from the force. That�s where the Old Constabulary recruit from. Their motives are to uphold the (previously established) law, and provide safety to those harassed for jumped up charges. Oftentimes they�ll be above average age for their race, and have a knack for blending in/remaining under the radar. Anyone ringing a handbell can expect a Constable to aid them, if one is within earshot.</li>
<li>The Glitter Court: they travel the land recruiting promising young beauties and train them in nobility, selling them off as brides/husband&#8217;s to knights and Lord&#8217;s without spouse</li>
<li>The Capstone Guild: An organization of mostly halflings, dedicated to the collection, cataloging, and study of the different mushrooms around the world. They know which ones are edible, which ones are poisonous, and which ones have special or magical properties. A member tends to always have some type of special or magical mushroom on hand, for emergencies.</li>
<li>The Rawhide Guild: A guild of leatherworkers, they are experts in creating clothing, armor, and any type of ornamentation in leather. A member&#8217;s uniform consists of a blue-dyed leather jerkin, leather pants, leather boots, leather gloves, all topped with a blue stylish leather cap.</li>
<li>The Kensington Tumblers: This guild is ostensibly known as an organization of acrobats and showmen, experts at putting on circus-type performances for the townsfolk. To those in the know, however, they have a reputation as the finest burglars in the business, and may be willing to steal certain objects for a client, if the price is right.</li>
<li>The Slave Traders Union: They would never trade slaves in an area where it is forbidden but this merchants guild will do anything and everything within the law to make as much money as possible. There is even a special division of lawyers dedicated to finding loopholes for lucretive streams of business. There are certain benefits to being a member so long as your fees are up to date such as if a member is accused of something illegal the guild will pay for their defense attorney. However of a member is ever found guilty of a crime then they will be outcast, fined, and forbidden from applying for new membership ever again. Their leader is a halfling with a silver tongue who has skin in the game in every game, and a pension for getting other people in trouble instead of themselves.</li>
<li>The Night Lighters: A union comprised of the men who are hired to light the torches and lamps around town each night. They&#8217;ve managed to intimidate the torchmakers and lamp oil salesman to the point where they have a monopoly on post-sundown light and are working to get the Continual Flame spell outlawed. But at least they aren&#8217;t a shadowy conspiracy that works in the dark.</li>
<li>Hand of Smaddur: Self proclaimed children of the smithing god, this group of Dwarves is known for their talent at making things. Tricks include making babies from metal, making mechanical limbs that can shatter mountains, swords that sing of peace and ships that become stable during storms. Their current leader is Haddrin Connor, a 350 year old who is known for his armor, the Dwegennaer, an armor that would shriek at attackers, stunning them.</li>
<li>The Path Walking Guild: Who keeps the walked paths walked? For a path Unmaintained becomes a path unwalked. A walked path is inviting, even if it leads through the dangerous wilds. These folk seek adventure and wish it upon others, however they see the difficult level of entry and so they vow to keep the paths walked so that fledgling hikers, travellers, merchants, and adventurers can go forth without fear and with some level of decency. Many are retired folk, and many are simply folk who care about their health. �Walk the path, my friends, so that others may follow.� Edit: some are map makers and contribute by prospecting new paths. Each year they hold a ceremony to announce the formation of a single new path. Each member walks on it. In doing so a brand new path is born. The guild values distance efficiency, terrain quality, scenic score, oxygen level based on elevation, and many other factors. Note that they value the origin and the destination less because they believe it is the journey that matters most.</li>
<li>The Silent Orchestra: A surprisingly large guild consisting of bards and some rogues. They are used to pass along messages to others, sometimes in secret, sometimes in public. The bards developed their own version of Thieve&#8217;s Cant and use it in song. This is especially useful when it comes to spreading a message quickly. Some bards travel on their own while others hide in a traveling group, unaware to having a Silent Orchestra member among them.</li>
<li>The Orphan&#8217;s Vow: a secluded, monastic cult of sorcerers who curse their gift of magic, refrain from practicing it under severe penalty, and pray their whole lives for it to go away.</li>
<li>Ylem�s Brothers: Guild of constructs named for the first successful creation of the great wizard Isemar. Ylem looked like a mortal man, but needed no sleep, could crush stone with its bare hands, and cast spells like a sorcerer; despite years of tireless work to better the kingdom, Ylem was eventually destroyed by a fearful populace that believed constructs were going to replace them. This guild welcomes all outcasts but especially warforged and other homonculi or those of mongrel blood &#8211; tieflings are a large randexpandity, and many of the members of the guild are sorcerers. They make their gold through typical mercenary work, but lend sorcerous aid to researchers and those who wish to study artificial life forms. Wise investment of wealth allows them to intercede on the behalf of artificial beings and mongrels everywhere who are mistreated. Their symbol is a brown field divided by black bands, a heart at its center &#8211; the heart is half flesh, half metal.</li>
<li>The Order of Militant Moderates: This cabal of ascetics firmly believe that mankind is unworthy of excessive reputation. They wear rough-spun robes of undyed wool and plain wooden masks to obscure their features. Each chapter meets once a month to nominate individuals operating within their jurisdiction who have gained too much acclaim. A vote is held and one target is selected. It is then each member&#8217;s duty to bring about disgrace and humiliation to that individual, by covert means. Additional Details: The Order employs methods of maintaining anonymity even during internal proceedings. This allows them to enact and discuss elaborate plots of humiliation against vainglorious citizens without accruing any renown even within their own circles. Larger chapters might nominate more than one target, but once nominated the target is never removed from the chapter&#8217;s bounty board until they have been suitably humiliated. Particularly prominent targets have, at times, been added to the list on a &#8216;for life&#8217; basis. They refer to one another as &#8216;Moderator&#8217; and believe they perform vital work to keep mankind&#8217;s ego in check. Outsiders often refer to them by the epithet &#8216;Peggers&#8217;, since they are said to be gripped by jealousy and obsessed with taking their betters down a peg. Any member inflicting more than superficial bodily harm against a target is subject to expulsion from the Order: Bruises and scrapes are acceptable, broken bones and cuts are not.</li>
<li>Victus Mercentile Guild: A merchant&#8217;s guild renound for their prowess and aggressive acquisition behavior. Originally tasked with keeping trade routes safe, they have since begun acquiring all shops, banks, and caravans, and enforcing various &#8216;Maintenance fees&#8217; on its members, while gray robed bureaucrats have become the norm in most cities.</li>

<h3>Festivals</h3>
(DnD Speak)

<ol>
<li><strong>Festival of Returns</strong> &#8211; Celebrated by keeping one&#8217;s door open all day during festivities. In remembrance of the day that countless missing people returned home after an adventuring group of paladins vanquished a coven of hags who had been stealing people away in the night for their rituals</li>
<li><strong>Weaver&#8217;s Eve</strong> &#8211; An artful festival for fabric makers. Celebrates the day when the nearby forest&#8217;s local spider population came to the townspeople asking for help to safeguard their nests from foraging cockatrices. The local seamstresses responded by making large, sturdy fabric webs for the spiders to hide in until the cockatrices could be dealt with.</li>
<li><strong>Day of Stone</strong> &#8211; Celebrated as a masonry recognition day. Began as a day of remembrance some hundreds of years before when Hunters returned to town only to find that every person had been turned to stone by a roaming Medusa.</li>
<li><strong>The Haunt</strong> &#8211; A day when people offload their grievances with one another, lest they be haunted by holding it in. In recognition of the day long ago when a necromancer bestowed a curse of silent aggression over the town until people began killing one another, then raising them for his army of dead.</li>
<li><strong>The Honey Moon festival</strong> &#8211; Every few months, the moon will rise with a golden glow for two or three nights. In the little town of &amp;amp;amp;lt;im bad at names&amp;amp;amp;gt; they say that the moon does this when someone, somewhere, finds true love. During these days, tables are set out in the streets and people ask others to join them on dates, platonic and romantic, underneath the golden moonlight (similar to real world valentines dates). </li>
<li><strong>The Barstool Burning</strong> &#8211; After an incident where a mimic disguised as a barstool bit off a chunk of a poor patron&#8217;s bum, the tavern&#8217;s inebriated clientele burned all its barstools in the street. An afternoon of drinking and building street bonfires made of barstools and other flammables has since become an annual holiday that has spread to all the taverns in the city. The taverns use the bump in proceeds to buy new barstools. </li>
<li><strong>Monster Parade</strong> &#8211; Once a year, all the cities in region hold a parade where all the participants wear elaborate monster costumes. Larger cities may employ magicians for special effects and have multistory beasts mounted on wheeled carts with movable parts and participants riding inside. The final attraction in the parade is the &#8220;holy paladin&#8221; with an elaborate armor outfit and costume weapons who is driving the &#8220;monsters&#8221; away. The role of the paladin is chosen by popularity contest or some other method, and is almost never an actual paladin. The parade celebrates a plot to deter a foreign attack by making it appear that terrifying monsters had already overrun the streets, yet they were easily defeated and driven off by guards. </li>
<li><strong>The Bath and Swim</strong> &#8211; This &#8220;festival&#8221; originated in a region with intermittent vampire problems. When another drained person is found, every man, woman, and child in the territory are ordered to assemble and wade across a shallow river. Immobile people are carried and then submerged. A census is then taken, and anyone who didn&#8217;t show up or refused (even visitors) is captured and dunked. Bored youths waiting for the trials to end soon started a now traditional swimming contest in the deeper part of the river. Thanks to a pair of enterprising visiting bards, a recurring comedy act developed. Two bards playing an oblivious guard and a vampire sit in a single large wooden bath and deliver &#8220;Straight Man and Wise Guy&#8221; skits. The comedy act has an informative end: it addresses vampire powers and weaknesses, and cautions against explicitly inviting anyone into your home, or your bath. </li>
<li><strong>Masquerade ball</strong> &#8211; An event for the upper classes and nobility. Participants ballroom dance while wear highly concealing masks and costumes. Because everyone&#8217;s identities are ostensibly hidden, participants are expected to cut loose. Statements challenging authority, outrageous clothing, lascivious dancing, public displays of affection, impoliteness, crude jokes, and open gossip is also permitted. Many champions of silenced and oppressed factions voiced their first manifestos here. The masquerade ball is a can&#8217;t-miss for anyone investigating aristocratic allegiances and doings, social climbers seeking courtly influence, and underworld rogues looking for high level protection and buyers. </li>
<li><strong>Catacomb Carnival</strong> &#8211; Once per year in the great cities the citizens head to the catacombs to celebrate another year alive and honor the dead interred in them by properly cleaning and arranging the bones of those that have been in the catacombs for a year into elaborate structures and designs. Any bones that are damaged in any way are burned in a great pyre in the city square and the ashes are used in the mortar of the bone sculptures below. They also leave offerings to the beetles and rats that do the job of stripping the bodies down to the bone. After the catacombs have been cleaned and the years previous dead have been attended to there is a day and night of celebration where revelers light the catacombs and tunnels and celebrate in procession above and below the streets wearing masks of beetles, rats, and skeletons to ward off any dark spirits and denizens that might also haunt the dark recesses below the city. </li>
<li><strong>The Minstrel Masquerade</strong> &#8211; A yearly festival wherein bards gather from every kingdom to enjoy one another&#8217;s company. Every bard seeks an invitation to such a jovial event, but only a few will be deemed worthy of winning a &#8220;Bardy.&#8221; The masquerade&#8217;s origin stems from the tragedy of Gerrick the Mad. Gerrick was a loyal jester, a bard of Lore, whom kept his sleepless king laughing for 3 months straight. Unfortunately Gerrick was only a man, a simple bard, and when the king finally gave word for him to stop jesting, he fell to the ground, stone dead. This festival exists to honor Gerrick and other bards alike for their insatiable desire to be the best artistic minds in their kingdoms, and the horrid sacrifice Gerrick made for the price of his King&#8217;s smile. </li>
<li><strong>The Salmon Bulb Run</strong> &#8211; It is this time each year that the giant salmon (which dwell within the nearby rivers) finish their yearly rot on the shores of nearby villages. You see, each year the salmon spawn, die, then float to shore causing a special type of psychedelic river mushroom to form on their carcasses (after they rot for approximately a year). These mushrooms are collected and shared amongst the Firbolg community as a right of passage. </li>
<li><strong>Winter&#8217;s Ritual Day</strong> &#8211; To prepare the day before, a branch of the sacred tree is cut and carved into a bowl, in it, runes are scribed asking for what you want come Spring and the next year; fortune, fertility or good health and inside is placed a special candle. After midnight, the candle is lit by a special bonfire created by the temple. A special ceremony is held at midday, where the priest incants a ritual spell ceremony, asking that the city be warded from the Spirit of Winter till next year. After this ceremony, which lasts 5 hours, the people drink ale and sup broth from their bowl cup (candle still lit hopefully), until midnight when they blow out the candle. If your candle goes out beforehand, terrible luck will befall you in the coming year. </li>
<li><strong>Day of Mending</strong> &#8211; A celebration to better one&#8217;s community and strenghten the bonds between townsfolk, this holiday is a day when tailors, crafters, smithies and similar trades set aside their work for a day offer their services for free on small projects for members of their community. As the holiday has grown, it has become a tradition for others to offer their goods and services to the community as well: bakers give away small food stuffs, taverns offer drinks on the house (one per customer!), and musicians and artisans flaunt their talents to all. Many enjoy the holiday as an opportunity to bond with their neighbors and community, while the more savvy use it as an opportunity for self promotion. The primary tenet of the Day of Mending is that old grudges and quarrels are set aside, if only for the day, and folk put the community ahead of the individual before the old business resumes on the following day. </li>
<li><strong>The Lovers&#8217; Return</strong> &#8211; One night each year, it is said that the spirits of a young man and woman return to roam the town where they died, looking for each other. Old tales tell of the young lovers kept apart, until one committed suicide from grief, only to be shortly followed into death by their partner. Now, the oldest townsfolk whisper of seeing the crimson specter of half-seen figures, sometimes a young man, sometimes a young woman, roaming the town on the night of the Lovers&#8217; Return, rapping lightly on the doors of homes to be let inside to search for their lost love. The townsfolk believe that hanging certain totems around their entryways will keep the lovers from coming to their doors, but even so, every few years a young man or a young woman goes missing on the Lover&#8217;s Return, presumably taken away by one of the specters mistaking them for their lost partner. </li>
<li><strong>Winter&#8217;s Offering</strong> &#8211; An old holiday, mostly celebrated by rural farming communities, it serves as both a celebration to venerate the old gods as well as preparing the villages for the winter to come. After the fall harvest, each household is granted a number of bushels of the food grown, while a large portion of it is prepared and sealed in unadorned clay urns to be buried in the ground and kept in reserve for the cold, hungry months of winter. As well, the villagers bury the bodies of their young at this time: the stillborn and the infants who passed in the previous year, their bodies prepared and buried in urns painted black, offerings to the old gods. The old midwives of such communities often keep unruly children in line with tales of how the cries and tears caused by misbehaving children echo into the ground and cause the blackened urns to crack, prompting their buried occupants to crawl their way out to the surface and drag away bad little boys and girls. </li>
<li><strong>Festival of the Sashes</strong> &#8211; to commemorate the purge of a despotic royal lineage centuries ago, when the ruling family was chased out of town by the commoners, their clothing stripped of their bodies as they ran through the streets. Groups and families prepare mannequins adorned with colorful sashes, each trying to make theirs the most elaborate and festive. The mannequins are then hoisted on poles and carried through the city. The groups race from Royal Plaza to the city gates. People line the streets and try to grab and tear handfuls of the sashes and ornamentation off as the mannequins pass. The atmosphere is very festive with public drunkenness and groups of young people chasing after the mannequins. </li>
<li><strong>Week of Rest</strong> &#8211; Neighbors take turns cooking meals for each other. Based on when a plague swept through the town and some got better while others got sick. </li>
<li><strong>Monument Race Day</strong> &#8211; It is said that when a near by volcano erupted destroying the old town, after evacuating their families many of the villagers returned to move the stone monument from the old town center to the new town�s location. In honor of this deed, every year on the anniversary of the eruption, the townspeople form teams that carry replica monuments in a race from the site of the old village to the monuments�s current location. Afterwards the town celebrates by having lava soup (a spicy red tomato based soup), with monument shaped bread rolls. </li>
<li><strong>Lamentations of the Cinders</strong> &#8211; a somber day of reflection on the anniversary of the Great Fire that killed thousands. At third bell after noon, which is when the fire began, people begin silently filing from their homes. Everyone covers their faces with soot and ash. Particularly devout people or older folk who lost everything in the fire may go completely naked and cover their whole body in soot. Citizens keep their faces downcast as they slowly walk a circuit around the neighborhoods that were most affected. A bell tolls every minute for the lives that were lost. At sundown everyone quietly returns home. Recently people have begun to include a great feast of preserved foods, like jerky, salted fish, and dried fruit afterwards. </li>
<li><strong>Last Tidings</strong> &#8211; It is said there once was a witchy lass who fell in love with a sailor. He went to sea and for twentyfive years she would wait for him at the sea cliff until the last tide went out at dusk. On the final night of her vigil on the last outgoing tide of the year she received word that her lover had perished. She cursed and vowed to the heavens that nobody would ever have to suffer and wait as long as she did for closure. She performed some unknown ritual and ever since that night, on the last out going tide of the last day of the year, anybody who whispers the name of a loved one on the seaside cliff will either hear the name returned meaning they were still alive or hear the cry of an albatross and know them perished. Two night long festivals have arisen one mourning the other joyous as lovers learn the truth. It is no coincidence that many of the single participants find comfort and more in each other&#8217;s company. </li>
<li><strong>Wall of Melons</strong> &#8211; A hundred years ago the city was under siege. The invaders climbed a wall to get inside only to be rebuffed by peasants who tore down their own homes to toss rocks down on the climbers. The day is celebrated by a committee selecting a portion of wall up witch a the town&#8217;s young men try to clamber. At top are an equal bumber of lasses armed with melons both ripe and rotten. It isbl traditional for the first climber up to ask for and be given the hand in marriage of his choice. The climbers are protected by feather fall spells and blanket carrying elders. </li>
<li><strong>Sweet Night</strong> &#8211; The orchids of fruit trees in the town&#8217;s fields are pollinated by bats from a local cave. This wasn&#8217;t known until a hundred years ago when a vampire ravaged the country side. It was tracked back to the cave and burned out, scattering the bats as well. The next years harvests were bad until a traveling holy man told the villagers they must lure the vats back. This was done by pouring syrup and other sweets out on a long path from orchards to cave. It worked and has become an annual event to remind and thank the bats. The sweets used have become candies for children and alcohol for adults. It starts with a barnfire at dusk and culminates in a long hike to the cave. Dancing and costume wearing is common as well as many bat theme toys and souvenirs. </li>
<li><strong>War of the Monsters</strong> &#8211; An Olympic sports like event with many different athletic competitions and games. The main event is a destruction derby style event where groups make &#8220;monster wagons&#8221;. Essentially people driven/powered wagons/carts that are made to look like monsters of the world (dragons, dire animals, beholders, etc). The goal is just to disable the opponents wagons, not hurt the drivers. Last monster wagon still able to roll wins. History harkens back to a day many many years, when several large wild monsters wandered into town at the same time. They ended up fighting each other rather then attacking the people, in a territorial dispute. This gave the civilians time to evacuate and adventurers time to gain control of the situation. Contradictory stories developed how one monster (it&#8217;s always a different one, since no one agrees which it was) was actually there to save the City from the other monsters. As several monsters actually escaped, this &#8220;hero&#8221; monster is said to still be out there guarding the city. People in the city are split into groups by what monster they believe is their guardian. </li>
<li><strong>Day of stillness</strong> &#8211; No-one goes outside or opens doors for 3 days. Very worrying to newcomers to the huge city. It is surreal to see a giant city completely still and silent. Almost no lights and no answers. In remembrance in how they barely escaped the plague by not greeting any infected during those trying times. </li>
<li><strong>Day of the Hawk</strong> &#8211; Adepts at the shortbow and longbow compete in a test of skill and accuracy (ex. piercing a thrown copper penny-sized item in the center), hitting fast moving targets from horseback. Gnome artificers, smiths, and other weapons craftsmen travel to the city from far and wide to tout their new inventions and wares. The festival began when the city was a small village and those who came of age had to prove their proficiency with the weapon as part of demonstrating their skills in order to successfully hunt and defend the community. </li>
<li><strong>The Day of Ribbons</strong> &#8211; An annual occasion where beautiful ribbons are tied to posts all over town. When asked why, people only give a somber look. Nobody speaks about it, giving the impression that it&#8217;s disrespectful and insulting to do so. </li>
<li><strong>The Night of Burning</strong> &#8211; In memory of the defeat of an ancient black dragon that had kept them in slavery, this town has an annual tradition where they kill, cook, and eat a juvenile black dragon. </li>
<li><strong>Orctoberfest</strong> &#8211; A yearly weeklong celebration commemorating the defeat of a massive army of orcs that had once besieged the city. Lots of drinking of fermented beverages, dancing, and general public revelry. </li>
<li><strong>Market&#8217;s Day</strong> &#8211; A day of great deals and bargains from merchants and vendors. It marks the beginning of the new market year and celebrates when the open trading and selling of dwarven and elvish wares to humans was legalized throughout the land. </li>
<li><strong>Candlenights</strong> &#8211; A night when the entire city holds a candlelight vigil until the dead of night, and then exchanging gifts and celebrating with a feast. Groups of families and neighbors stand around the city in patches, while holding their candles up high. This commemorates the time when a group of adventurers killed a nest of gold dragons, relieving many of the farmers of the fear of being killed and their crops burned. The adventurers brought back the dragon&#8217;s hoard to share with the town, but because of a raging blizzard, had to be guided in by groupings of torches.</li>
<li><strong>Day of Snakes</strong> &#8211; a day literally celebrating the existence of snakes. Vendors sell all kinds of snake-related items, restaurants serve dishes with a bit of snake flair added on, and people release their pet snakes all around town. This goes far back to when there was a large rat pestilence in the town, and it looked like it would never get better until a random snake merchant came to town and offered to begin breeding snakes for them in order to control the population. Disease rates fell, overall cleanliness increased, and the town felt better overall after the rats were driven down to a dwindle.</li>
<li><strong>Propitiation of the Twins</strong> &#8211; around twenty years ago a pair of shooting stars appeared in the night sky. Soothsayers and astrologers predicted that this would usher in a new age of prosperity. People began leaving offerings in public squares to entice &#8220;the Twins&#8221; to bless their household. Now, every year on the anniversary, people have continued the tradition by lighting two candles and leaving a small bread cake in a public area at dusk.</li>
<li><strong>Boulder Pushing Day</strong> &#8211; On this day every year, the town splits into 2 teams (east and west). Using the whole town as a playing field, they attempt to push a boulder sized ball (many years ago they realized that a real boulder caused too much damage to the town)towards the opposite side of town. The winning team must push the ball into the outskirts of the town on the opposing side. It�s a friendly competition akin to a high school sports rivalry. Those who cheat or intentionally hurt others are looked down upon by their peers. The town sits in a u shaped valley that they say the gods carved out by rolling a marble on flat land. </li>
<li><strong>The day of Ashes</strong> &#8211; more of a ritual than a actual holiday. At this specific day of the year, the towns women get dressed in white and their faces are covered behind a veil. They roam the streets in packs singing and dancing, while the men, all dressed in black, try to coerce the women into having intercourse. Women are treated like goddesses, gifts are given to them and they have free choice of taking or refusing a partner. Each woman has a pot filled with ashes with her. After they have found and bedded their man of choice, they empty their pot onto his clothes, so the other women know not to touch them. This tradition comes from ancient times, when after a volcanic eruption the lands were covered with ashes and many people were killed by the initial eruption or starved to death in the aftermath of the event. To ensure the survival of the ancient tribes in this region, the council of all tribes instated the law of reproduction. What the town celebrates today is the day for the gods and the women, who ensure the succession of their lineage. </li>
<li><strong>Festival of the Drink</strong> &#8211; Long long ago, a small group of dwarfs set out into the wilderness to establish a new outpost for the glory of their empire. When they finally settled down, they were quickly able to establish a secure outpost with plenty of food, but soon they realized they were missing one of the most important supplies of all. Alcohol. Without this necessity, order soon began unraveling in the fledgling outpost, until the lone brewer was forced to improvised. Facing no other choice, she ordered everybody to gather as much of any kind of fruit that they could find. Once the gathering was complete, she worked tirelessly for a week straight to make alcohol out of anything the other dwarfs had brought, churning out such strange brews such as cherry wine and plum cider. At the end of this massive burst of brewing brilliance, the anxiously waiting dwarfs were finally rewarded with the finest tasting drink they had ever tasted in their life. In remembrance, the now flourishing Dwarven outpost celebrates this event in it�s history by holding a festival every year where brewers compete to create the best brew possible from the local fruit chosen for that year. </li>
<li><strong>The Sun God Observation Day</strong> &#8211; On this day all the village observers the sun god. I.e. stare at the sun as long as possible. The people at the village do this because an old witch told them that it would prevent them from seeing the destruction of the village. Since everyone is mostly blind her prophecy seems to have come true. </li>
<li><strong>Wishmore Night</strong> &#8211; The city holds a festival at the docks, all walks of life are included and encouraged to mingle with each other. Everyone, either individually or in groups create floating wreaths in whatever way they want to present it. At midnight when the water is still, the leader of the city will wade out into the water and release their wreath first, as an offering to the gods. Everyone in turn will release theirs following the leadership, before returning to the festivities which will often go long into the next night. This celebration is to thank the gods for a bountiful year, or even a year of character building (in case of hard times). It is to mourn those lost in the Shipping routes and to pray for the safe return of others. If the water isn&#8217;t disturbed except for the wreaths, it is fabled to be a year of easy storms for the sailors. It is also of note that these wreaths never ever turn up anywhere else in the world. They disappear completely.</li>
<li><strong>Celebration of Destruction</strong> &#8211; The Nine Hells love the awakening of the tarrasque so much that they make it a festivity. The celebration comprises of feasting upon whatever the titan destroyed and watching it as it rampages through entire cities, leaving nothing but rubble and dead life of all varieties in its wake. After the gargantuan beast falls asleep once again, all of devil kind praise the strength and ferocity of the powerful tarrasque. </li>
<li><strong>Ale Day</strong> &#8211; A dwarven celebration that simply commemorates the invention of their favorite drink. It quickly spread to many other humanoid peoples. Dwarves and satyrs love it the most. </li>
<li><strong>Owlbear Memorial Day</strong> &#8211; Elven cities that use owlbears as defense use this day to give thanks to the beasts that have protected their land for decades, sometimes centuries. The whole town offers food of all kinds for the creatures below. It�s very easy to argue that the owlbears enjoy this day more than the elves above ever could. </li>
<li><strong>Festival of Life</strong> &#8211; A celebration of the Upper Planes where the denizens of the heavens celebrate the good in every creature of the Material Plane. Commonly occurs when large amounts of good, neutral, or unaligned creatures are born. This involves animals and humanoids alike. A huge feast is held with some of the most delicious food in existence. </li>
<li><strong>Day of the Arts</strong> &#8211; An elven celebration where every form of art is honored. For months before this day, humanoids all across the Material Plane prepare songs, plays, dances, paintings, sculptures, and many other forms of art. A favorite day for many satyrs, with many placing it right behind Ale Day in their lists. Bards of many peoples are particularly fond of this festival. Silver dragons also love to celebrate alongside the humanoids that have arrived. </li>
<li><strong>Beholder Day</strong> &#8211; A holiday invented by beholders to celebrate themselves. They give themselves presents, and demand that their servants get them presents or they die. If a cult has decided to worship the floating aberration, the beholder will only have to remind its worshipers once and it has a myriad of presents coming its way. Unlike normal holidays that occur annually, Beholder Day happens once every week. </li>
<li><strong>Cliffton Day</strong> &#8211; Cliffton was a local legend who long ago had defeated a demon water elemental which came upon the small fishing village of Mistwood. They celebrate his triumph every year with contests which correlate to what traits he was known for. Whoever wins any of the contests then participates in a final contest, the winner of which is given the title of &#8220;Aspect of Cliffton,&#8221; and is then invited to participate in a ceremonial recreation of the famous battle. They are given a costume and Cliffton&#8217;s old ax and told to strike down an effigy &#8211; a standing effigy of the demon is already in center of town, but underneath the rags which make up the costume is a bound man, the village drunk, being put to death without knowledge of the adventurers. Maybe now that the adventurer is close to the figure, they can hear strained breathing amidst the cheers and song of the villagers. If they refuse to complete the ceremony, the same water demon who attacked the town years ago rises from the nearby lake and threatens to destroy the town once again. As it turns out, the killing of a man in the ritually-prepared town square once a year is part of a ritual that keeps the demon at bay. </li>
<li><strong>The Betrothment Battle</strong> &#8211; Every year on the first weekend after the Summer solstice, the town plays host to a wrestling tournament and exhibition. Hand to hand fighters from across the realm come to the town to prove their mettle, and rings are prepared for non-tournament participants to settle small arguments that have built up over the year. Named for a famous fight in the town at the wedding of the Mayor&#8217;s son and one of the prominent merchant&#8217;s daughters that saw the merchant, the mayor and most of their families tear apart the public house, the tavern, and a stable in an hours long fight. </li>
<li><strong>The Wardens Gauntlet</strong> &#8211; In the spring the city&#8217;s best and brightest face each other in a series of physical and mental challenges. Some are complex rituals, puzzles and riddles testing mind and spirit. Others are tests of endurance, agility, and strength. Betting and boasts are a much enjoyed portion and the contests themselves are openly viewed by the public to cheer on their favorites. The top three are given the honorary title of Warden followed by celebration where the previous Wardens hand off the mantle to any new Wardens or retain their station from the previous year. These Wardens represent the common people in matters of ceremony and any concerns or grievances to the Crown and city councils until the next years contest. Being a warden is often the path to guild leaderships or council seats and even titles from the crown. The history behind the trials and celebrations is vaguely remembered from the time of city states when open warfare was avoided by settling issues between the Wardens of each city state. There was also a darker reason for the intricate rituals and ceremony. Now considered just a spiritual and mental exercise, they serve an unknown purpose strengthening ancient Runes and Spells against something truly horrific that is ever vigilant and hungry. </li>
<li><strong>Stabbing Day</strong> &#8211; Using fake daggers the populace honors the day a group of rouges saved the city from a dragon attack. It&#8217;s exactly what you think, expect red dye stains. </li>
<li><strong>Rom&#8217;Chuk</strong> &#8211; Local barbarian tribes meet together in an unfortunate city and hold a Dwarf tossing contest. Use of Gnomes with fake beards is extremely frowned upon. </li>
<li><strong>Siggi&#8217;s Birthday</strong> &#8211; A great shield maiden gave her life to save the city. Women can let anyone they are sweet on know by picking them up over their shoulders and hauling them off. Siggi wasn&#8217;t known for her subtlety. Rooms at the Inn are free in her honor. </li>
<li><strong>The Games</strong> &#8211; A week of festivities that include games of all types under the sun; from dexterity-tests like obstacle courses, to strength competitions such as log-tossing, and even an academia note to it, like a spellcaster&#8217;s competition. This week of fun was created some time ago when a tyrant ran the city with an iron fist. Once a year he would force his supplicants to participate in crazy games which usually ended in their death. Once he was overthrown, the citizens opted to keep the week of festivities, whilst removing the &#8220;death&#8221; part. It helped the community grow closer, keeping those with terrible ambitions out.</li>
<li><strong>The Pilgrimage</strong> &#8211; A day when every person in the city is expected to &#8220;carry their weight&#8221; and bring their greatest distress out in the open, so that their neighbors, friends and community may support them in earnest. Those who refuse to participate are exiled from the community until they complete a pilgrimage to the neighboring continent and bring back something that will actively make their community better; be it money, food, or magical wards. This is a practice from when the city was still just a fledgling town and every person needed to pull their own weight, and everyone relied on everyone else to support each other.</li>
<li><strong>Lottery Day</strong> &#8211; A crop fertility ritual where outsiders are encouraged to attend. Eventually someone is picked at sundown and stoned to death by the crowd. Do not take the raffle tickets they offer&#8230;but there are prizes afterwards. </li>
<li><strong>Day of the Horn</strong> &#8211; the ceremony draws in tieflings like moths to a flame. Almost hypnotized by the low droll of an ancient obsidian tiefling skull horn being played amongst the music. Dusk brings the climax of the festival where all the spirits of an ancient battle posses the revelers and show them an ancient battle where a contingent of tieflings rebelled against their fiend masters and joined with the townsfolk to drive the demons back to Hell. The leader selflessly gave her life to save her comrades and new friends by blowing a smoldering hole through the chests of no more than 15 fiends&#8230;leaving just her skull. &#8220;We Remember&#8221; is the mantra and afterwards the tieflings are thanked and cared for with the thought &#8220;We can be more than the sum of our parts&#8221;. </li>
<li><strong>Madel&#8217;s Star Day</strong> &#8211; A meteorite fell to form a crater where a town eventually sprang up. The 5 meter rock absorbs all hostile magic and steals any illusions. The soothing rhythmic glow is amazing to behold. Only a handful of elders have metal bracelets fashioned from the meteorite that allows them to cast spells in town. Only one new one is awarded every century. In town it allows for casting of spells, outside of town it has a chance to absorb a hostile one (even your own). The properties of the stone also royally mess with any Warforged that come into contact with it. </li>
<li><strong>Grey Snow Day</strong> &#8211; A volcanic instability in the area uncovered a ruined fiend city. Excavations uncovered ancient masks that the party goers wear. The volatile nature of the masks grant a limited form of fire manipulation after sun down. The party notices that a vague form of possession is slowly corrupting the crowd every year. </li>
<li><strong>Fomarath Day</strong> &#8211; Laurel and oak wreaths are adorned and offerings prepared for the four treefolk guardians in a nearby permanent druid grove. A group of Hill Giants were about to lay waste to a group of farmers when a druid and his party drove them off. The druid stayed behind for a year to make sure the spell would stick. The treefolk actually love the townsfolk and have attracted other peaceful sentient plants. </li>
<li><strong>Craghoof Moot</strong> &#8211; A nomadic band of centaurs and a nearby halfling settlement have a very intertwined history of one ancestor saving another or one group saving the other from invasion. The most noble thing a member could do is swear an oath to one another to ride together for a year and a day protecting the territory. The amount of high grade alcohol and mead available is mind boggling. Watching halflings in war paint and centaurs in straw hats and vests is quite hilarious. </li>
<li><strong>The Druid Chain festival</strong> &#8211; As a last ditch protection against incursions into this dimension three druids, twelve elementals, and three dragons can unite and merge for a primordial ritual called a Gaia Chain to drag whatever horror that threatens all existence into the maw of the planet itself trapping it within the molten core for all eternity. It kills all those involved and as such the three temple locations became holy places to all forms of life. It is the raw elemental fury and power of the first ones that saved the world are remembered in giant soul crystals that once a year show the images of these lost heroes. </li>
<li><strong>Broken Toy Day</strong> &#8211; Warforged holiday marking their Independence. </li>
<li><strong>The Anniversary of The Great Mayhem</strong> &#8211; Recalls the day tribe of barbarians, orcs, and goblins laid absolute waste to a city of necromancers, warlocks, and wizards. </li>
<li><strong>Eeling</strong> &#8211; every autumn as the eel population in the local reservoir grows too great, the Swanmay invite the local village to come and collect as many as they can stock for the year. While fresh eel is on the menu, the festival itself is a community occupation, jarring eels, processing oil from them and otherwise making sure that what they want will keep until next year. Large communal tables are set up in the town square and the locals gather early to get a place at the centre most tables where gossip and ale flow strongest. </li>
<li><strong>Digging High</strong> &#8211; At summer solstice the various dwarven families of the area come to The Kin Hole, where they will mine as one for the three days of the festival. The hole itself is barren of valuable minerals, but the myth that the families&#8217; ancestors divined great wealth for all dwarven kind at its completion still exists. While much merriment is made by the dwarves, the presence of outsiders is an immediate dampener. </li>
<li><strong>Gluttony</strong> &#8211; though not a festival per se, the first two months of the year are always eagerly anticipated by the hobbi&#8230; the halflingses of Portree. The tradition of the wealthier houses organising lavish bashes during the time as a means of canvassing has replaced a very loose sense of meritocratic governance with a very enthusiastic intoxicracy. </li>
<li><strong>The Quiet</strong> &#8211; in the old days, the village of Pertiv was in a most precarious position. Early settlers had grouped to farm an area which they only later realised was threatened by orcs, owlbears and darker things from below. While everyone celebrates the heroes who saved the village all those years ago rambunctiously in Spring, in late autumn the people remember the early days of fear and salvation by drinking heavily together in silence. Any but the most necessary and cursory communication is looked down on, and there are those in the village old enough to remember those times from their childhood. </li>
<li><strong>Fyre</strong> &#8211; The burning of the Winter Witch. They say that the Winter Witch (who is the spirit of winter) is dull and dreary, but can be driven away with humor and merriment. Villagers celebrate by erecting bonfires and once the sun touches the horizon they are set alight. They drink mulled wine, play games in the snow and sing crude songs to drive the Winter Witch away. </li>
<li><strong>Grimm</strong> &#8211; Orcish first blood ritual. An orc is a child until they are blooded, among the more civilized tribes of orcs this takes place in a festival called Grimm. Those deemed worthy or are brazen enough to try form a Wog or raiding party then a suitable target is chosen usually small Kobold warren or goblin outpost. All participants must bring back a heart for Grummush (their god) and a head to prove their prowess. </li>
<li><strong>Spring Break Wizard Demolition Derby</strong> &#8211; A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice wizards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The wizards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to show off their spells to intimidate rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply cause chaos. In order to keep the wizards out of town proper and redirect the damage, the town sets up beer gardens, bathrooms, dirt cheap &#8220;inns&#8221;, and other sacrificial establishments on the beach. The student wizards naturally make it their goal to destroy absolutely every temporary structure they can, culminating in a massive destruction derby on the final night. Meanwhile, the city residents cower and hope the dispatched army can keep them from invading and burning down the town, again. </li>
<li><strong>Spring Break Playwright Championship</strong> &#8211; A popular beachside town is inundated by hundreds to thousands of student and apprentice bards from several large nearby schools out on holiday break. The bards inevitably form carousing groups, get absolutely sloshed, and then try to outdo the acts of rival schools, impress potential dates, or simply make a name for themselves. In order capitalize on their creative output and increase tourism, the town builds temporary theaters on the beach. The student bards naturally make it their goal to claim the most audience. Students create original productions in several different categories, marching band, full orchestra, historical drama, tragic opera, comedy musical, dance, etc. and debut them head to head against rival groups from all the different schools. The one who captures the most audience wins. On the final night, all the student bards join together for an all night jam session. The city residents who aren&#8217;t spectating are out cold after over-drinking during productions. (Free alcohol is often used to bait audience members.) </li>
<li><strong>Spring Break Ascetic Training Festival</strong> &#8211; A popular mountain town is inundated by hundreds of student and apprentice monks who jogged hundreds of miles to sit under cold waterfalls made of fresh snowmelt. The monks tend to be fairly orderly since this location is a prime spot to focus one&#8217;s ki and discover new techniques. Some waterfalls have better reputations than others, so the student monks will challenge each other for superior meditation spots. The poor fasting students monks tend not to bring much revenue, but tourists who want to watch them fight do. The town constructs several &#8220;arenas&#8221; sculpted from natural materials with silenced stands so the monks are not disturbed in their combat or meditation. The town hosts a streetside festival with many booths on the final day with rich foods for the starving monks and tourists to enjoy. Some more enterprising monks also do demonstrations or offer basic self-defense classes to tourists. </li>
<li><strong>The Bathing</strong> &#8211; Held at the height of summer. A highly respected priest started this tradition many years ago for those who could not afford to enter the elitist bath-houses. Townspeople gather at the calmest part of a great river just outside of town and bath naked. Considered a family friendly event, those who attend forgo their qualms about nudity and know that all are equal in the eyes of the constantly moving water. </li>
<li><strong>Lock Day</strong> &#8211; A small town dug up a mountain 90 years ago to make room for a new city hall, but ended up finding a black safe with an unbreakable lock. It can&#8217;t be moved or destroyed by any means (even a disintegration spell). Every year, they have a big festival where people try to open the lock. Everyone expects them to fail, but it&#8217;s the fun in trying. They amp them up too; an announcer holler their praises&#8230;&#8221;weighing in a 220 pounds, the scourge of Neverwinter, the axe-wielding monster, [barbaian character name]. But there&#8217;s drinking, dancing, a ceremony from the town&#8217;s Cleric, trading, cookies and cakes for sale. It&#8217;s a wonderful good time. Then&#8230;one day&#8230;the safe opens by itself. </li>
<li><strong>Independence Day</strong> &#8211; celebrating independence from a former ruling nation. Tons of drinking and local food that other nations think you always eat, but you really don&#8217;t eat as much of it as they think. </li>
<li><strong>Celebration of Armistice</strong> &#8211; Once a year, the ambassadors of every major city in the neighboring continents bring gifts to all the smaller hamlets and towns around the land. Gifts include anything from supplemental food to last for a long winter, new technologies, mages looking to relocate and can lend a hand to smaller communities&#8230; This tradition goes back some centuries, long enough that even few elves remember the origins. Legend says that a great tyrant sought to control the lands around, and a massive war raged for a long time. Eventually the tyrant was assassinated from the inside of his court, and his officers extended an olive branch to the peoples around, before disappearing themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Festival of Limitless Water</strong> &#8211; A yearly celebration in town, where townsfolk race boats, swim, drink locally brew beer and feast on roasted fish. A reminder to appreciate the gifts the waters bring them, and to remember the year a storm tore through the town, destroying most of the crops and buildngs. The boat race is a recreation of the villagers urgent travel seeking aid. </li>
<li><strong>Leatah&#8217;s Warming</strong> &#8211; the town celebrates the anniversary of their religious rebith to the forest spirit Leatah, who accepted the hospitality of the town many years ago. They believe her to be the cause of their town&#8217;s good fortune. On those rare occassions she still visits, she assumes that they treat every visiting spirit the same. </li>
<li><strong>Zarantyr</strong> &#8211; The Zarantyr Drumming Festival &#8211; Focus is on drumming and singing. This harkens back to the community&#8217;s roots as a marching war band, before they settled in and created their own kingdom. </li>
<li><strong>Olarune</strong> &#8211; The Rough and Tumble Games &#8211; Personal combat and feats of strength. A good old fashioned brawl designed to allow aggressive supplicants to get out their aggressions with one another, ensuring that there can be a peaceful year within the city. </li>
<li><strong>Therendor</strong> &#8211; The Festival Restorative &#8211; Focus is on healing, health, love and renewed. Held by the House Jorasco. When a war raged nearby and people from all sides wandered in, hurting, House Jorasco responded by creating a safe haven for anyone injured, while nearby clerics or apothecaries would come in and provide rejuvenation to those hurt. </li>
<li><strong>Eyre</strong> &#8211; The Thing Extraordinary Crafter&#8217;s Show &#8211; Focus is on crafting. Held at the western caravan junction. This was set up to commemorate the sudden and mysterious disappearance of a local nomadic people, who would always stop here and hold an exposition for their greatest craftsmen. </li>
<li><strong>Dravago</strong> &#8211; The Dravago Stock Fair &#8211; Contests of halfling and their mounts. A large community of halflings decided they wanted to play a larger part in their community, so they created this fair in order to raise funds for the city. It turned out to be a hit, and the halflings have been heralded as heroes to their city from that point onward. </li>
<li><strong>Nymm</strong> &#8211; The Grand Cookoff &#8211; Contests of the best food and drink. It&#8217;s held in Gatherhold by the House Ghallanda. The roots here go back a very long time to when the local Patriarch would force his cooks to eat their dish in front of him, to ensure that it was not poisoned. Long after he died, the tradition was carried on, but without the terrible connotations. </li>
<li><strong>Lharvion</strong> &#8211; The Costumed Carnival &#8211; Everyone is in costume and there are costume games. From a rather scary time in the city when it was invaded by an outsider army, and everyone had to be as resourceful as they could with making disguises to fit with the plethora of monsters that the outsider&#8217;s army used. </li>
<li><strong>Barrakas</strong> &#8211; The Hide and Seek Fair &#8211; Games of hide and seek, scavenger hunts, treasure maps. Goes back a ways to a deadly cartel that used to torment the people of the city, demanding that they follow maps to find these &#8220;treasures&#8221; that usually lead to many people missing or dead. </li>
<li><strong>Rhaan</strong> &#8211; The Festival of Letters &#8211; A grand book and scroll fair where the halfings get together and have contests of words. It is an homage to the Renaissance of prose int he land, where it is legend that all of the world&#8217;s greatest writers were suddenly struck with inspiration. </li>
<li><strong>Sypheros</strong> &#8211; Paint and Lantern Festival &#8211; The cultural event of contests of plays, and light and illusions. This has become tradition from long ago, before written history was a thing. All history was passed down via stories, or even play-like things being acted out. </li>
<li><strong>Aryth</strong> &#8211; The Great Headstrong Races, this is a time of personal speed races; foot races, climb races, mud tobogganing, etc. A festival honoring the legend of Aryth, who is known as the fastest creature to live. Aryth ran a very long distance in order to warn the city of an approaching army, and the entire town survived because of it. They say that he ran so fast, that his soul ran right out of his body, because he died shortly after delivering the warning. </li>
<li><strong>Vult</strong> &#8211; The Rogues Escapade. A fair about getting into and out of trouble. Teams devise cunning traps that the other team must escape from, then they switch. This stems from when the forefathers of the community all organized an incredible jail-break to escape from a tyrannical leader and set up their own independent state. </li>
<li><strong>Fields of Cabbage Festival</strong> &#8211; Heads of cabbage are provided to all attendants, wherein they must begin to eat the cabbage. Attractions there include all kinds of ways to prepare cabbage, giant cabbages that have been hollowed out, cabbage stories, cabbage planting seminars. The person who eats their head of cabbage is declared the winner, and the winner must dictate when and where the next festival will take place. This strange celebration goes far back to when the only thing that a nomadic tribe of people had left to eat was cabbage, and some people went insane because of it.</li>
<li><strong>Day of the Siren</strong> &#8211; Quite unnerving for a first time traveler to witness. About 1/3 of the city&#8217;s population will meet in the square every 3-4 hours during daylight, and only once after nightfall. They will scream, shriek, wail, shout, or otherwise make vocal noise at the highest possible volume. This came about as a defense from a siren who once lured too many of the city&#8217;s capable workers during a particularly hard summer. The shrieking was designed to scare off the siren as her song was sung, and after it was confirmed she had died, the city kept it up as a final insult to the dead fey.</li>
<li><strong>Founder&#8217;s Blessings</strong> &#8211; A day when the local clerics hold a vigil in the streets, doling out blessings or healing as needed. Anyone is welcome, but in order to receive such a gift, one must recite the names of the city&#8217;s founders. This was made a way to keep the legacy of the four sisters who founded the city alive and well, and to make sure that the community always had a way to remain healthy.</li>
<li><strong>Bride&#8217;s day</strong> &#8211; Commemorating the beginning of summer, all the new brides dance with the unmarried women, to imbue to them their own marital fortunes. The dance takes place in the kings courtyard and no males are allowed in. At the end the queen usually tries to set up an unwed dancer with a royal family member. </li>
<li><strong>Maiden&#8217;s Night</strong> &#8211; a night when all unwed virgin girls/women gather with their fathers for a Father/Daughter dance, where the girls will pledge to remain abstinent until they wed. This became tradition after some time ago when an old drake demanded a dowry of virgin girls. The town was once burned down by the drake after it found out that the townfolk had lied about some of the girls.</li>
<li><strong>A Dog&#8217;s Day</strong> &#8211; a day when all collected dogs in various animal control facilities are released. This came about after a group of druids wildshaped as direwolves saved the mayor of the city from a painful death. Before leaving, the &#8220;direwolves&#8221; told him to make sure every dog has it&#8217;s day.</li>
<li><strong>The Number Crunch</strong> &#8211; A day when all master ciphers and code breakers have a competition for the favor of being security consultant for major companies. Stemming back years before when the city was settled by a multitude of competing kingdoms, and the entire populace was convinced that everyone else was a spy, while also trying to convince everyone that they were not.</li>
<li><strong>Day of the Shouting Stone</strong> &#8211; local barbarians meet up to scream at a large boulder on the edge of town. In barbarian lore, it is fabled that this stone was one a powerful barbarian who shouted at another, larger boulder until it split in two, and he was then transformed into a boulder himself.</li>
<li><strong>Anthem</strong> &#8211; the proud holiday of the city where a multitude of people gather drunkenly in the streets to sing bawdy songs loudly and obnoxiously. Anyone who asks them to keep quiet is met with a barrage of rotten fruits and/or vegetables. This comes from a long time of religious oppression brought by a cadre of evil paladins. The singing was the first act of rebellion, and the rotten fruits signify when the city folk began attacking to drive them out.</li>
<li><strong>Sturgeon&#8217;s Wish</strong> &#8211; people catch wild sturgeon in the nearby river, put them in portable tanks and spend the day feeding them all kinds of crap before sending them back off to the river. Lots of fish due this way. Origins are iffy, but there&#8217;s a legend about a giant talking fish that came out of the river and asked for food from the elders of the city.</li>
<li><strong>Bargaining Day</strong> &#8211; A day when all villagers have a chance to ask their greater community to help them with something. The community can ask for something in return, or nothing at all. No guarantee of a request being honored, even with payment given. This dates back to when the town used to have an elder dragon living beneath it. They would plead with the dragon for help, and it would make requests of them, sometimes with a promise to honor their plea, but often ignoring them.</li>
<li><strong>The Rain Run</strong> &#8211; One the day of the first rain after the summer months, the entire town gathers on the outskirts and has a race. Anyone who finishes in the top ten are exempt from the strenuous labors that come with damming up the rivers, or strengthening the embankments around the city to prevent mudslides. This promotes a lean and fit community.</li>
<li><strong>Silence Peak</strong> &#8211; A day when no one in the city will utter a single word. All communications are done using basic sign language. Anyone who speaks is tied up in the middle of the town square for the remainder of the day. Going back to when a powerful and malevolent wizard ruled the region, using listening spells to seek out malcontents and squash rebellion before it began. Eventually people coordinated in silence, and he was over thrown.</li>
