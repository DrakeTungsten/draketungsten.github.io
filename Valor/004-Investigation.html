<h1>The HB Investigation Template</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>
	2 decks of cards
</li>
<li>
	One six-sided die
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overview And Design Notes</h2>
<p>
	This investigation mechanic is meant for solo play. For a "planned" mystery run by a human brain, see your local GM.
</p>
<p>
This mechanic provides an abstract representation of a trail of investigation which leads either to a solution or a dead end. It's up to the player to interpret the result of each turn in terms of their story.  
</p>
<p>
	The expected average length of each investigation may be adjusted, as well as the difficulty (difficulty meaning the chance of the investigation never being resolved).
	</p>
	
<p>
	My goal for this sytem was is to allow for an investigation into a question or problem my PC faces, which takes the form of following a trail of clues. 
	Most importantly, I needed a system which is as intuitive as possible for me. 
	So I wouldn't claim this is the best system for anybody else, or that this does things you can't get elsewhere, but I wouldn't use anything but this.
	To have a logical progression of clues, I have abstracted the what a clue is, and put the logical progression/connection of one clue to the next in the hands of the player. This is why I call this an investigation "template". 
	I also wanted to include the ability to have some control over the length of the investigation and its difficulty (i.e., the chance of the investation leading to a dead end.) 
	I play sandbox-style, so the possibility of a foiled investigation is a feature, not a bug. I don't <i>want</i> a guarantee that the mystery will ever be solved (unless the nature of the mystery makes a solution guaranteed). 
	If the investigation goes nowhere, then I'll just attack the problem with a really big hammer, or move on to something else. But I would also keep in mind that this mystery which my PC couldn't solve is still a part of the game world.
</p>

<h2>The System</h2>
<p>
Start with two piles of cards, coming from two separate decks: One is the Clue pile, and the other is the Investigation pile. Decide what the average number of clues you would like this investigation to run (max of 6). This number will be referred to as the ANC number (Average Number of Clues). 
</p>

<p>
<h3>Build the Clue pile:</h3> 
<ul>
	<li>
		1 Ace: The mystery-solving revelation
	</li>
	<li>
	    2 * ANC amount of face cards (excluding aces): These Jacks/Queens/Kings are clues
	</li>
	<li>
		2 Jokers: Investigation boost
	</li>	
</ul>
Shuffle this pile.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Build the Investigation pile:  </h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		2 * ANC amount of (non-Ace) face cards. These are "Discover Clue" cards. 
	</li>
	<li>		
		4 * ANC amount of number/non-face cards (these are baby Step cards). Shuffle. 
</ul>
Shuffle this pile.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Build the Cold Trail pile:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
	 Take the top card from the Investigation pile to start a new pile which initially consists of just this one card. 
		</li>
		<li>
	 If this is your second attempt to investigate this mystery, then move an additional amount of cards equal to the ANC from the Investigation pile to the Cold Trail pile.
		</li>
	</ul>
	The only way to use cards from the Cold Trail pile is by drawing a Joker from the Clue pile.
</p>


<p>
	<h3>Starting The Investigation</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
Decide on your in-story avenue of investigation, based on the subject of your investigation. For example, cruising the underworld, poring over dusty tomes, or physically searching a given area for some kind of clue. 
The avenue of investigation doesn't matter to the HB Investigation Template. As far as the cards and die are concerned, the avenue is purely cosmetic. 
It's totally up to the player to hang the story on the card flips and die rolls. You are making this decision as the PC.
		</li>
		<li>
Decide on what the resource usage die represents, based on your avenue of investigation. 
The most obvious reource is time. But it could be time + accumulation of favors owed, etc... 
If you find that 1-6 is too wide of a range of resource expenditure per investigation card flip, then feel free to scale back the range. You are making this decision as the GM.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>


<h3>The Investigation Turn</h3>

<p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Roll the Resource Die.</b> Before rolling, if you don't want to risk any more of the current resource(s) you assigned to the Resource Die, then you can re-assign what the RD represents, as long as you can justify it in-story, and you need to pay the price of moving the top Investigation card to the top of the Cold Trail pile.
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you rolled a 6, then you still have to pay, but if the card you flip is just a Baby Step, then you may discard it and flip over the next Investigation card for free.  
			</li>
			<li>
				Deduct or advance (or whatever) the rource(s) as indicated by the die roll and what resource it currently represents.
			</li>		
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Draw the top Investigation card.</b>
		<ul>
			<li>
				If you draw a Baby Step card (a number card from 2-10), then this turn is over. Discard the card. If this was your fourth consecutive Baby Step, then move the top card of the Investigation pile onto the Cold Trail pile (man, this investigation is really going nowhere). Story-wise, a Baby Step represents that you're making little progress, and it's time to decide if you're going to spend more resources to continue this investigation. Feel free to narrate the Baby Step, possibly using an open-ended oracle. If you're going to continue, then start a new turn.
				<ul>
					<li>
						If the Resource Die roll was a six, you may flip over the next Investigation Card for free (IOW, start the next turn without rolling the Reosurce Die again)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				If you draw a Discover Clue card (a face card) from the Investigation pile, then turn over a card fom the Clue pile. Interpreting the Clue Card:
				<ul>
					<li>
						Ace = Mystery solved.							
							Narrate the revelation. Use an open-ended oracle if that's your thing. 
					</li>
					<li>
						Jack/Queen/King Clue = Discard this Clue card, and discard the Discover Clue card.
							Narrate what the clue is. Use an open-ended oracle if that's your thing. Story-wise, decide where this clue is leading you next, and based on this decision, decide what resource(s) the Resource Die should now represent. Start a new turn.
					</li>	
					<li>
						Joker (Investigation Boost): 
						
						Put your Discover Clue card back in the Investigation pile and shuffle it.
						Move the top card from the Cold Trail pile onto the top of the Investigation pile, and start a new turn with it, skipping the die roll. You may also change the resource representation of the Resource Die for free.		
						If thas was the first Joker you have drawn from the Clue pile, then discard it. If the is the one remaining Joker and there are at least five other cards in the Clue pile, then return the Joker to the Clue pile and shuffle. If not, then discard the Joker. 								
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>	

</p>

<p>
	The investigation is over when the mystery is uncovered (The Ace has been revealed from the Clue pile) or when you hit a dead end (you have run out of Investigation cards).
</p>

<p>
	If an investigation fails, then you may restart the investigation at a disadvantage. Use the same cards you started the first investigation with, and to apply the disadvantge, deal a number of additional cards from the investigation pile to the inital Cold Trail pile equal to the ANC. An investigation can only be retried once, unless circumstances drastically change. Story-wise, you should start from a different angle from the first investigation. 
</p>

<p>
	Optional Rule: If the first Investigation card you turn over is a Discover Clue, and the Clue card you turn over is the Ace, then there is a one-in-ten chance that Daphne, The Goddess of Mysteries, is offended by all of the detective work you by-passed, and smites you where you stand. 
</p>


<h2>Difficulty Adjustment And Final Design Notes</h2>
<p>
	"Difficulty" means the chance of the mystery eventually being solved or not. This is in contrast to the expected length of the investigation, which can be changed by using different values for the ANC. 
	You can set up a mystery which is guaranteed to be solved, but which has the possibility to have a long investigation.
</p>
<p>
	Every time you need to move a card from the Investigation Pile to the Cold Trail Pile, there is a 33% chance that it is a Discover Clue card. 
	The closer that "Mystery Solved" Ace is to the bottom of the Clue Pile, the more you will need those Discover Clue cards. 	
</p>	
<p>
	The best way to increase the difficulty of an investigation from the outset is to move more cards from the Investigation Pile to the Cold Trail Pile.
</p>
<p>
	The best way to decrease difficulty is to add more Investigation Boost cards to the Clue Pile, since these are the only way to get access to cards in the Cold Trail Pile.
