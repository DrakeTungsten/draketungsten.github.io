Bodies of Water 
In a typical campaign world, rivers and lakes serve at least two 
important purposes: They provide a ready source of water, and 
their presence requires a party of adventurers to be more versa- 
tile. A body of water is both an opportunity and a challenge. Tra- 
vel on the surface of a lake or river is often faster, easier, and 
safer than negotiating the surrounding terrain on foot - but only 
if characters have access to a boat or a barge and someone in the 
group has the skill to handle the craft expertly. Swimming across 
a deep, wide river, instead of following the shoreline and looking 
for a place to ford, can save hours or even days of travel time - 
but only if characters have the ability to swim in the first place. To 
be fully prepared for a trek through the wilderness, a party of ad- 
venturers should have equipment and skills for coping with 
bodies of water as well as for moving on land.
