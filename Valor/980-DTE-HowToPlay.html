<h1>First Steps</h1>
Conflict:
<ul class="naked">
	<li>Man v Man</li>
	<li>Man v Nature</li>
	<li>Man v Himself</li>
</ul>
Scenes:
Get in late and leave early

<p>
The <i>in media res</i> approach that most solo players favor is not for me. It removes agency from my character right from the start, and it implies some back-story that I didn't play through, so it feels like getting cheated of story experience. I'm starting out with my character being pro-active. I also notice that the <i>in media res</i> examples I've seen usually involve some major world-building, but I already have the world I want. I will will be randomly generating some deatils of the world, but not the major aspects like I see others doing.

<h1>QUEST FOR METAL</h1>
<p>
At age 14, Uncle Zee had to take me along to a sodality (long story), where I heard the magic of metal. I must learn more about this.
