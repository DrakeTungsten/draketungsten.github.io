<li>You come across a trail of blood (unicorn) leading to a spooky forest.</li>
<li>The party is followed by an owl, hooting softly, eyes glowing the gentle yellow that might be magic or might be simple reflection.

Then, one of the owls scratches a message into the dirt, before flying off into the night- FOLLOW.</li>

<li>Kobolds have been attacking the town. All wearing similar regalia and a matching symbol. a raving man claims to have escaped from the kobolds&#8217; lair.

<li>The moon stops traveling across the sky, and everyone&#8217;s time pieces stop working. Word around the continent is a group of warlocks are attempting to gain power from a new patron &#8211; the god of Time</li>
<li>More than three people in a given town have all their teeth fall out at the same time</li>
<li>A nearby civil war is raging, and one of the high ranking officers of one side or the other holes up in a cave. If approached, they will act incredibly defensive. A child is crying somewhere deeper in the cave, and this person refuses to answer any questions about said child.</li>
<li>An allegedly crooked officer of the law is found dead in an alley way and only one person in the whole town seems to care about it at all.</li>

<li>Walking through town, the party suddenly gets surrounded by the city guard. A respected captain was murdered. Witnesses say they saw someone looking similar to one of the party members. Upon looking through their things, said member appears to have lost an item easily traced back to him (one half of a pair of gloves/earrings/daggers, family insignia, one of a kind necklace etc.). Sure enough, said item was found at the scene of the crime. Someone is framing them. Not necessarily a doppelganger.</li>
<li>The party stumbles across a dead old man. Amongst his meagre belongings is a thick tome with extensive records about everything they�ve done right up till today, with even more detail than they themselves knew.</li>
<li>The party finds various dead animals with missing pieces, almost torn and shred. As they approach the heart of the forest the number of dead creatures increases. Upon investigation they find out it&#8217;s the guardian spirit of the forest who has been corrupted and it&#8217;s confused.</li>
<li>A flyer appears in the sacks of each party member. A mid level demon has opened a store and invites all those with ambitions to visit to make deals.</li>
<li>A rumor reaches the party&#8217;s ears of a group of brigands hiding out in the woods. They have a code that is the reverse of Robin Hood and his Merry Men: Steal from the poor, and give to the rich. None of the local nobles seem interested in the pillaged goods of their subjects, and are constantly giving back the loot they keep finding on their doorsteps.</li>
<li>The local apothecary is desperate due to the sudden absence of all the local medicinal plants in the area. All the groves and clearings appear to have been picked clean, and even the owner&#8217;s secret garden is now empty. She had told no one of her hidden garden, and so has no idea who or what could have taken all of the plants in the brief period of time between her most recent check and her previous one.</li>
<li>A human peasant and a member of the fey came across each other in the woods and, over the course of multiple moonlit encounters, fell deeply in love. The peasant&#8217;s family has a deep-rooted fear of the fey, and is actively trying to put a stop to the pair&#8217;s relationship. The family is even more fearful that the peasant will leave for the Feywild and never return, and goes to the party to convince them to help break the two lovers up. The human is in love with the Fey&#8217;s otherworldly allure and sharp wit; talking to them makes the peasant feel alive in a way that they&#8217;ve never felt before. The Fey was originally only interested in the concept of a secretive human lover, but eventually came to love the peasant&#8217;s dedication to their relationship despite the risk of alienating other loved ones.</li>
<li>While at the market waiting for another adventurer to arrive, you pass the time by idly counting the number of stone gargoyles mounted on the town hall. There are fourteen, all with a silly grin.</li>
<li>While at the blacksmith to repair your armour, you overhear the blacksmith explaining to his apprentice to not stray off to the hills to see his new sweetheart because he heard from the baker&#8217;s cousin&#8217;s stepmother that there are kobolds about.</li>
<li>While waiting patiently for your turn to see the Bishop, you get your ear bent by some local shopkeeper about how the town council is a bunch of idiots, and how they simply wasted all that money on getting 13 gargoyle statues erected on the town hall. Thirteen! That&#8217;s an unlucky number!</li>
<li>A street urchin attempts to filch your purse, he runs off down an alley. The urchin escapes, but in the alley you found a homeless halfling bum. Clearly dead. Looks like he fell from a great height.</li>
<li>The price of that foreign wine you like so much has tripled in price. The barkeep mutters something about pirates. The barkeep explains it&#8217;s just a euphemism for the wagoneers guild and their extortionate ways.</li>
<li>A dead homeless halfling found in an alley had a small bottle of very cheap whisky. The label has a brand mark you&#8217;ve not seen before &#8211; 4 vertical slashes and 2 short slashes across the bottom.</li>
<li>The pommel of a sword you found on your last adventure rattled loose. Inside you a scrap of parchment with lots of scratchmarks, almost looks like writing.</li>
<li>A wanted poster has been nailed up &#8211; Wanted: Black Pete, for Brigandry.</li>
<li>The scribe you made inquiries with last week has got back to you. She says the Tomb of Three Chieftains can be found outside Millthorp.</li>
<li>While at market, you saw three wagons being carefully guarded by scruffy and shifty looking mercenaries. There are barrels of cheap rotgut in the wagon.</li>
<li>A pilgrim accosts you in the street. He asks if you&#8217;ll be travelling east anytime soon.</li>
<li>The bakery has no cake. He explains it&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a shortage of milk.</li>
<li>A patrol of the Kings Guard rode fast down main street. They almost ran you over.</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a parade of pilgrims on main street, heading for the commons. They appear somber and morose.</li>
<li>Southbridge, just outside town, has been closed to traffic due to disrepair. Merchants complain about the 2 hour detour they now incur by first heading east.</li>
<li>The town guard are seen practicing new drills on the common. Apparently a local bandit has enlisted a wizard, and so training in avoiding fireballs is called for.</li>
<li>The local priesthood is paying gold for water collected from the Opal Caves to treat a spreading fever</li>
<li>An apothecary will pay for certain herbs growing in the Frog Marches.</li>
<li>The local Stonecutters Guild are not petitioning for work contracts; labourers are grumbling.</li>
<li>A frost giant approaches the group. The giant politely asks for help. He lost his pet owlbear and needs help finding it. He promises a very handsome amount of gp as well as �a powerful ally� if you find the creature.</li>
<li>A goblin in noble clothes crashes through the window and rolls over the ground. The symbol of the king&#8217;s guard is embroidered on his half-cape. As he gets up, he panics and looks around, fixing his eyes upon the party. &#8220;The Goat-Riders are coming! Please, hide me!&#8221;</li>
<li>A large burly man has started a daily ritual of throwing a goat at the side of a local noble&#8217;s house.  He is not damaging the house, so he is not doing anything that will make the local law enforcement arrest him, but the noble wants him dealt with, and will pay you to get rid of him, however.</li>
<li>A sword in the stone can be sensed by all creatures in the land with &#8220;Detect Magic&#8221; but lately it seems that the presence is becoming overbearing.  Magic users are worried that unless the true king draws the sword, proving his lineage, or the spell &#8220;Detect Magic&#8221; will become obsolete.</li>
<li>As the group walks through the forest, one member hears very quiet crying. The crying is coming from a lost juvenile harpy. It is the job of the group to protect this harpy. They can either keep and raise the creature, or return it to its mother.</li>
<li>The party finds a smouldering crater containing a metal wreck. Inside, they find an eccentric kobold who insists she has returned from the moon.</li>
