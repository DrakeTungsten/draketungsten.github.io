<h3>DRAGON PODS</h3>
<p>
The first generation of dragon pods were the conduits through which Tabifi unleashed the Dragon Force into the world. All subsequent generations are inert in this regard. They are, however, useful (necessary, in fact, as far as anyone knows) for Kin to access the DF. 
</p>
<p>
    Pods are rare but easily recognizable. Their rarity is in relation to the general quantity of vegetation in the area. They are the size of two fists, and their coloration always includes green, blue, and orange, but other colors my be included. They are sparsely covered in a hiar-like substance that seems to be as much animal fur as it is vegetable fiber.
</p>
<p>
The pods may be consumed without any known injury or benefit. Their taste varies from specimen to specimen, but is rarely pleasant. They are filling but of little nutritional value.    
</p>
<p>    
    <h4>Using dragon pods to manipulate the Dragon Force</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Squeeze a whole pod over your eyes and allow the juice to flow over your eyes. This allows you to see the threads/waves/eddies of the Dragon Force. This effect lasts for half an hour.</li>    
        <li>Pulp the flesh and rub the pulp over arms and hands. This allows you to manipulate the DF. This effect lasts for two hours.</li>
    </ol>
    DF manipulation consists of directing multiple threads of the desired force to loop and bind over a charm, in such a way that a quick release can be made (DF knot tying is a learned art), which then causes the effect. Hopefully. The user does not need to be within arm's reach of the charm - the threads may be manipulated at a distance, but the closer, the better.
    <br><br>
    Note that the manipulation effect lasts an hour and a half longer than the sight effect. This means that unless the user has a few more pods to use on their eyes, he needs to keep his hands very still for that hour and a half, lest he unwittingly causes some effect.
    <br><br>
    Your face and arms and hands will be stained for days, so it will be obvious to everyone for several days that you have recently doused yourself with a pod.

        Control
            <ul>
                <li>Gross kinetic control (easier)</li>
                <li>Fine kinetic control (harder)</li>

    <li>Unidentified 3</li>
</ul>

<h3>Charms and Sympathies</h3>
<b>Earth</b> Charm sympathies
<ul>    
    <li>Lineage</li>
    <li>Contains Piece of target</li>
    <li>Shape</li>
    <li>Mass ratio, charm::target</li>
</ul>

<b>Water</b> charm sympathies
<ul>
    <li>Thinness of vessel</li>
    <li>Elemental Shape (flatness of vessel</li>
    <li>Clarity of liquid (or color match if target liquid has color)</li>
    <li>Mass ratio, charm::target</li>
</ul>

<b>Air</b> charm sympathies
<ul>
    <li>Thinness of vessel</li>
    <li>Elemental Shape (sphericality of vessel</li>
    <li>Suspension (altitude) of vessel</li>
    <li>Mass ratio, charm::target</li>
</ul>

Water charms generally require a vessel, although natural bodies of water may serve. Air charms always require a vessel. In either case, the vessel is an impurity, and so it's overall mass compared to its volume is a hinderane to the desired effect.
<br><br>
A larger charm requires a longer binding time, but increases chances of success.

<h3>Variables</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Distance from user to charm</li>
    <li>Distance from charm to target</li>
    <li>Sympathies between charm and target</li>
    <li>(Im)Purity of binding (dependent on user skill)</li>
    <li>Tightness of binding (dependent on user skill)</li>
    <li>Quantity of binding (time spent / charm size)</li>   
    
</ul>
